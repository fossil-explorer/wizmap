The incorporated PCM allows shifting the energy demand for building cooling. A simulation case study is implemented to investigate the energy flexibility of an office building conditioned by the proposed system in a hot and humid climate. At first, the thermal storage properties of the macro-encapsulated PCM were determined by using the standard ASTM C1784-20. The obtained properties were then used in a whole-building simulation model validated using measurements in a real size walk-in chamber. Three different performance indicators were used to quantify energy flexibility: available storage capacity, storage efficiency, and power shifting capacity. Results show that with an average panel to ceiling ratio of around 66%, the radiant ceiling panel has an average sensible heat storage capacity of around 430 Wh/m2day and average annual storage efficiency of 86%. Results also show that the proposed system can shift the electric power demand for conditioning by 8 h compared to a conventional all-air system. These results confirm the benefit for implementing Demand-Side Management strategies that can exploit the energy demand flexibility of radiant ceiling panels incorporating PCM. \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd", "2022"]

The economic viability of RECs though, depends on multiple interdependent factors that require careful examination for each individual context. This study aims at investigating the impact of electricity tariffs, ratio of electrification of heating and transportation sectors, prices of RE technologies and storage systems, and internal electricity exchange prices on the annual cost for electricity provision of a REC and its GHG emissions. A mixed-integer linear model is developed to minimize energy provision costs for a representative REC in Flanders, Belgium. The results indicate that RECs have the potential to reduce these costs by 10 to 26% and emissions by 5 to 13% compared to business-as-usual. The cost reduction depends on the type of electricity tariffs and the level of uptake of flexible assets such as heat pumps and electric vehicles. The shift towards a higher power component in the electricity tariff makes electricity storage systems more attractive, which leads to higher electricity self-consumption. The introduction of flexible assets adds the possibility to shift demand when tariffs are lower and makes higher installed capacities of photovoltaic systems economically viable due to the increase in the total electricity demand. However, RECs cost reduction compared to individual smart-homes amounts to only 4%\u20136% in the best cases. Uncertainties stemming from the costs of setting up a REC may reduce the estimated benefits. \u00a9 2022 The Author(s)", "2022"]

Smart homes/buildings are key sub-categories of smart grids. The advanced metering infrastructure connected to them continuously captures and stores the energy consumption data as datasets. Usually, understanding the structure of data and the behaviour of customers from energy consumption datasets is a tedious task. There are some literature works tried to explore various smart home energy consumption datasets as well as investigate customer behaviour, however, most of these methods are complex in implementation. Hence, this paper proposes a simple approach for the comprehensive exploration of the smart home energy consumption dataset. This approach can be used for any similar smart home dataset that contains numerical data. Further, using the exploration results, this paper analyzes the customers\u2019 energy consumption behaviour by identifying peak hours in communication and electrical perspectives. To implement the proposed approach, an energy consumption dataset \u2018Tracebase\u2019 is considered as a case study. The exploration of the considered dataset results in 2356 files distributed among various directories. For customer behaviour analysis, the energy consumption data of all 43 appliances (with more than 95 million records) is considered from the \u201ccomplete\u201d directory of the \u201cTracebase\u201d dataset. This analysis revealed the peak hours as hour-23 from the communication perspective and hour-9 from the electrical perspective.

We find that the US commercial natural gas demand is price inelastic, with statistically significant (p-value \u2264 0.05) static own-price elasticity estimates of \u22120.137 to \u22120.245, short-run \u22120.152 to \u22120.261 and long-run \u22120.281 to \u22120.463.

Further, they vary by season and region and their size has been slowly declining over time. Finally, commercial natural gas shortage cost declines with the size of own-price elasticity estimates. The policy implications of these findings are: (a) price-induced conservation's likely limited effect on the US commercial natural gas demand justifies continuation of energy efficiency standards and demand-side-management programs for deep decarbonization; and (b) demand response programs such as real time pricing and reliability differentiation efficiently allocate limited supply of natural gas during a shortage among heterogenous end-users, thus reducing an economy's aggregate natural gas shortage cost. \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd", "2022"]

These events leads to damage to distribution grid equipments, and they are cause widespread blackouts. This paper presents short-term resilience enhancement of the residential sections against hurricane at day-ahead. The lines outage in the electrical distribution grid is implemented as stochastic modeling by hurricane. The resilience enhancement is done in the multiple energy systems such as integrated gas, heat and electrical. The three-stage multi-objective functions optimization is proposed for resilience-oriented enhancement. The proposed strategy for resilience-oriented enhancement including installation of the mobile generators (MGs), implementation of the demand side management (DSM) strategy and local generation (LG) in each stage. In first stage optimization, minimizing the installation costs of the MGs is modeled subject to lines outage. The DSM strategy is modeled in second stage optimization as minimization of the electrical demand deviation than optimal demand level at day-ahead. Then, minimization of the 1) operation cost and 2) loss of power supply probability (LPSP) index are considered in third stage optimization.

This paper investigates the impacts of subsidy removal on future electricity demand and the required generation mix. A hybrid modelling framework is developed to analyse supply and demand sides under harmonised assumptions. An autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model combined with an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model forecast electricity demand under subsidy removal scenarios at different paces. A partial equilibrium energy systems model (MESSAGE) offers a cost-optimal configuration of power generation technologies to meet the forecasted demand during the period 2017\u20132050. The findings demonstrate that energy subsidy reforms can reduce total electricity demand by 16% and could ensure a 31% cut in cumulative CO2 emissions. The scenario analysis also shows that under an early and steady reform scenario and with gradual removal, the development of renewable energy technologies and energy efficiency plans become cost-competitive. In contrast, the late and rapid subsidy removal path should tackle the lock-in effect's risk. This reveals that the early action in energy subsidy reform should be considered a priority over the removal speed.

Reliable load aggregation is critical for LSEs to improve profits in electricity markets. Due to the uncertainty, the actual aggregated response of loads obtained by conventional aggregation methods can experience significant deviations from the bidding value, making it difficult for LSEs to develop an optimal bidding and scheduling strategy. In this paper, a bi-level scheduling model is proposed to maximize the net revenue of the LSE from optimal DR bidding and energy storage systems ESS scheduling by considering the impacts of the uncertainty of demand response. An online learning method is adopted to improve aggregation reliability. Additionally, the net profit for LSEs can be raised by strategically switching ESS between two modes, namely, energy arbitrage and deviation mitigation.

In the approach, instantaneous energy consumption is modeled by analyzing the power characteristics of various load types.

Sector coupling strategies (i.e., power-to-heat) represent a solution to this issue since they enable demand-side management strategies by increasing energy flexibility. Among the others, electric boilers are commonly used to convert electricity into heat, but they are characterized by high radiative heat losses (i.e., the high surface temperature of components) with the consequent risk of unwanted combustion events. Electrode boilers that are based on ion acceleration principles can reduce this risk since they usually operate at a lower temperature. This study focuses on the performance assessment of an electrode boiler. The power-to-heat conversion efficiency is experimentally determined for three configurations of the apparatus, which are determined by varying the velocity of the pumped fluid. The II and III velocity levels are respectively assessed in test one and test two, while the \u201cunderfloor heating system\u201d setting (i.e., constant hydraulic head) is evaluated in test three.

In this paper a novel Direct Load Control mechanism is proposed, wherein control is based on technical constraints (generation capacity). To determine the effects of the proposed mechanism, a case study of the Indian State of Karnataka is carried out. The results indicate 0.88% energy savings and a reduction of almost 2% in regional peak loads in a state where only around 5% of all households have AC units. The case study shows that an AC Direct Load Control can have significant economic and environmental impacts, and can help improve current energy, water and climate issues. Continuous improvements in both energy access and economic conditions of developing regions are leading to a larger number of AC's installed, meaning that a mechanism that enables sustainable AC consumption could be of great use for all the stakeholders in the developing countries' electricity sectors. \u00a9 2022 The Authors", "2022"]

The retrofit programs are developed to minimize the cost for peak demand reduction while maximizing energy use savings to select sets of energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies for various residential building prototypes prevalent in Saudi Arabia. The effectiveness of large-scale implementations of optimal retrofit packages is evaluated to assess their cost benefits as well as their effects on shaping Saudi electrical load profiles. It found that the optimal retrofits are more effective than the deployment of rooftop PV systems in reducing both peak demand and annual energy consumption for Saudi housing stock. In particular, the analysis indicates that retrofitting the housing stock with one energy efficiency measure reduces electrical peak demand at 779 USD/kW lower than that attributed to deploying rooftop PV systems. \u00a9 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.", "2022"]

However, privacy concerns related to the processing of user personal consumption data often result in a slow wide-scale adoption and acceptance. Various general purpose cryptographic techniques are available, such as homomorphic encryption and secure multi-party computation (MPC), to address these privacy-concerns. Unfortunately, these come at a significant computation price which makes them not applicable in many practical scenarios. In this work, a privacy-preserving aggregation algorithm, based on additive random shares and a combination of well-established symmetric and asymmetric key cryptography methods is proposed and compared with additive homomorphic encryption (AHE) techniques and state-of-the-art MPC protocols. The results show that generic techniques such as homomorphic encryption come with significant computational and communication cost, especially at the users side. On the other hand, MPC approaches provide better performance and resilience to dropouts for very large networks but entail a complex communication among users. In this context, the proposed additive random shares algorithm was the most balanced choice for DSM, with a good performance, simpler information flow and the possibility of adding redundant intermediary parties for enhanced resilience. \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd", "2022"]

It has gained remarkable attention due to the advent of new technological paradigms such as smart grid concepts and renewable energy resources. In this study, the effects of Demand Response (DR) as an emerging strategy of demand side management have been investigated on generation investment planning for achieving a technical, flexible, economical, and reliable solution for the supply side in the long-term. To this end, taking the advantage of system dynamics concepts and tools, the modeling of both principal DR types, i.e., price-based and incentive-based, is explored. In the first type, we formulate a novel market-based mutual relevance between market clearing price and willingness to pay of the price-based loads for accurately obtaining the electricity price as the primary signal for the investment process. The uncertain behavior of loads in these programs is expressed with a new concept called Certainty of Responsiveness (COR). A novel index, namely Loss of Load Duration Margin (LM), is proposed to incentivize the participants in incentive-based DR. Dispatching of these loads has been done using options contract. Numerical simulations are performed on a typical test supply system. Wind and solar photovoltaic units as the leading renewables in power systems are considered alongside the conventional thermal technologies. Different regulatory decisions about the adjustable parameters of DR programs are also analyzed. The results validate the effects of DR programs on total installed generation capacity, market prices, reliability indices, and outage costs in the long-term. \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd", "2022"]

End users can handily receive real-time prices and adjust their electric energy consumption behaviors. Acquiring the time-varying price elasticity of demand (PED) of electricity can help utility companies to understand the time-varying electricity consumption behavior affected by price, thereby facilitating demand-side management. However, estimating time-varying PED is rarely considered in existing studies. This paper bridges the gap, proposing a time-varying PED estimation algorithm. To analyze PEDs more precisely, the proposed algorithm is applied to each appliance based on the advanced non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) technology. Moreover, a demand-side smart dynamic pricing mechanism is also proposed to provide decision support of individually optimal dynamic pricing for utility companies to encourage end users to participate in the demand response (DR) program. Comprehensive experiments have been conducted to validate the practical feasibility of the proposed mechanism.

Demand response (DR) is a promising flexible resource for alleviating the supply-demand matching of high-proportion renewable energy systems. With the application of modern technologies, the potential for residential DR is growing. Electricity price is the key to improving residential DR capacity. However, existing dynamic pricing programs may fail to motivate end-users to adjust demand based on fluctuations in wind and photovoltaic (PV) output. This study proposes a dynamic pricing model that combines the fluctuation characteristics of residential electricity demand and wind and PV output, and utilizes bi-level optimization to coordinately dispatch the flexible loads. A case study of smart residential community consisting of 200 households shows that dynamic pricing incentivizes residential consumers to shift flexible loads from morning and evening to noon or early morning, which effectively improves the degree of matching between wind and PV output and residential electricity demand. Moreover, bi-level optimization effectively alleviates the potential rebound peak caused by large-scale residential participation in DR and achieves a relatively flat net grid demand profile. Furthermore, the dynamic pricing can incentivize residential consumers to participate in DR by reducing electricity bills. \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd", "2022"]

However, the uncertainty of renewable energy sources and the diversity of load types pose a threat to the microgrid's stability. Recently, energy scheduling optimization for microgrids (MGs) has been primarily based on ideal models, but incorporating as many real-world characteristics as feasible can improve the reliability of the optimization outcome. This paper provides a multi-stage methodology for solving the energy management optimization (EMO) problem of MG under uncertainty considering carbon trading market and demand side response (DSR). To begin, scenario analysis method was used to address the uncertainty associated with RE in MG, and four typical scenarios of renewable energy were generated. Then, the flexible configuration and operational constraints of each power source in MG are dealt with under the premise of considering the carbon trading market. The third stage involved merging the characteristics of various load types and analyzing the response impacts of different percentage residential and industrial loads, respectively, using the price-based and load-transfer-based DSR approaches. Finally, quantum particle swarm optimization (QPSO) algorithm was used to obtain the optimal solution. The acquired results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed multi-stage energy optimization framework, and support the following two conclusions: 1) The carbon trading market policy contributes to the reduction of carbon emissions and fossil fuel consumption. 2) A high load participation rate in DSR can increase MG operation economics by up to 27.48% compared to not considering DSR. \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd", "2022"]

However, besides PV intermittence, limited reserve and time-consuming replenishment of diesel fuel in remote areas make it challenging to guarantee long-period reliable power supply. In this paper, a risk-aware energy scheduling and stochastic optimization method is proposed to enhance long-period operational reliability of independent MGs. The possible extreme scenarios in the future are considered in an energy scheduling optimization model (ESOM). Based on energy forecast results of PV and loads for the next 7 days, ESOM maximizes the reliable power supply probability by optimizing energy scheduling strategies and reserve requirement for future operational risk simultaneously. Subsequently, a day-ahead stochastic optimization model is established to determine optimal power scheduling strategies of DG, PV, ESS, and flexible loads. The conditional value at risk (CVaR) is used to address the operation risk caused by uncertainties of PV and loads. Compared with traditional day-ahead optimization methods by numerous simulations, the proposed method has less expected load losses and PV curtailment, as well as less total supply-demand deviation. The resistance for future operational risks of independent MGs is therefore significantly enhanced. \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd", "2022"]

Meanwhile, the literature on demand side management (DSM) has ignored the value of agricultural demand as a demand side resource for integration of renewable energy. This article fills the gap by collecting agricultural load data from two distribution utilities in the Indian state of Gujarat and using it in a mixed-integer linear programming model to estimate the flexibility provided by agricultural DSM to the power system. Using a flexible load representation, the model chooses the optimal periods for agricultural supply subject to the constraints of meeting the irrigation needs of farmers and the marginal cost of electricity. This analysis shows that management of agricultural demand already reduces system costs by 4% or USD 6.09 per MWh of agricultural consumption. Going forward, with high shares of solar generation, shifting agricultural demand to daytime hours increases system flexibility. It reduces renewables curtailment by 4\u20137%, limits cycling costs of coal power plants, and reduces system integration costs by 22%.

However, the temporal configuration of renewables requires that demand adapt accordingly. Introducing intermittent electricity production will thus require end users to be more flexible in their use of electricity. Flexibility capital has been promoted as a concept for analyzing material preconditions in order to understand how providing flexibility might interfere with the daily life of the users. However, this concept focuses mainly on (im)material resources, while the social and temporal factors of society that also mediate flexibility have been less emphasized. The aim of this study is thus twofold: 1) to summarize all research published thus far on flexibility capital, and 2) to reconceptualize the concept by integrating aspects of socio-temporal configuration. The result is a more nuanced concept of flexibility capital that considers the role of both (im)material resources and social and temporal factors, such as norms, conventions, shared space, others, and bodily needs. Conceptualizing flexibility capacity as capital directs attention to a number of social implications. First, it highlights how the uneven material distribution in society may amplify social inequalities within the energy sector. Secondly, it questions whether electricity uses are inherently flexible under the current socio-temporal configuration of society. Thirdly, it warns that organizing the operation of energy systems around end user flexibility renders the users a commodity instead of giving them agency. These insights contribute to the field of energy justice by showing how flexible energy use can be evaluated according to the energy justice principles. \u00a9 2022", "2022"]

Due to their decentral and intermittent nature, these technologies require robust planning that considers non-technical constraints and flexibility options to be integrated effectively. Energy system models (ESMs) are frequently used to support decision-makers in this planning process. In this study, 116 case studies of local, integrated ESMs are systematically reviewed to identify best-practice approaches to model flexibility and address non-technical constraints. Within the sample, storage systems and sector coupling are the most common types of flexibility. Sector coupling with the transportation sector is rarely considered, specifically with electric vehicles even though they could be used for smart charging or vehicle-to-grid operation. Social aspects are generally either completely neglected or modeled exogenously. Lacking actor heterogeneity, which can lead to unstable results in optimization models, can be addressed through building-level information. A strong emphasis on cost is found and while emissions are also frequently reported, additional metrics such as imports or the share of renewable generation are nearly entirely absent.

Consumers/prosumers are increasingly exposed to and may benefit from time-differentiated energy prices aimed to induce changes in regular consumption patterns. These changes are also beneficial for retailers and grid operators in face of the variability of wholesale market prices, renewable energy availability and grid conditions. The optimization models to be implemented in autonomous home energy management systems require a rigorous modeling of appliance operation to generate effective load scheduling solutions, respecting their physical operation principles and use patterns in everyday life. A balance should be sought between the detail level of optimization models and the computational requirements to generate usable solutions having in mind their implementation in low-cost processors. This paper presents a comprehensive and modular set of mixed-integer linear programming models aimed at enabling their seamless incorporation in home energy management systems, allowing for the integrated optimization of all energy resources (exchanges with the grid, load management, electric vehicle and stationary battery, local microgeneration). Detailed energy consumption optimization models for shiftable, interruptible and thermostatic loads are presented, also including the power cost component and ways of dealing with user's discomfort. The modular models are presented in a building block manner enhancing the flexibility of their utilization in overall models with different objective functions encompassing the economic and comfort dimensions. Computational results are presented for a case study using actual data, which considers a time-of-use tariff with six periods. In addition to comparing with a plain tariff scheme, different consumer profiles are simulated to assess the impact of comfort requirements on cost.

To ensure the effectiveness and stability of the solution, the existence of Nash equilibrium (NE), its quality and multiplicity are thoroughly investigated for the system model consisting home appliances, distributed energy storage (DES) and dispatchable generation (DPG). The payoff function of the formulated game is not strictly convex due to addition of DES and DPG. Therefore, the proximal decomposition algorithm (PDA) is utilized to get the NE of the game. The convergence of PDA has a strong dependency on system parameters. A rigorous mathematical proof is provided for the condition of convergence of the PDA.

While former mainly improves thermal comfort of inhabitants so does latter unlock ecological and financial opportunities mostly for energy utilities. Commonly, dynamic indoor conditioning is based on piece-wise constant indoor temperature constraints. This paper's contribution is the presentation of additional constraints: in particular ones expressed relative to the nominal behavior of a hydronic heating system. This allows to simultaneously harness the relevant process variables in particular during the pre-loading and post-loading phases of a load reduction. The findings are based on data sets acquired on 10 inhabited, residential buildings in Stockholm over a whole year. One of the findings is that building models need to be adaptable if predictive control is applied in practice. This adaptability is assured by a novel concept, i.e. a so called model manager on which the control is relying for the selection of the most accurate model. Centralized optimal control of buildings connected to a district heating network is challenging in practice due to a high computational load.

A microgrid (MG) is considered a sustainable energy system but due to the uncertain nature of renewable energy resources (RERs) and electrical load, it requires an optimal and efficient energy management system (EMS). It is vital for optimal usage of distributed energy resources (DERs) in a secure and reliable way. This function of EMS is performed by an advanced decision-making approach which is present in it. In recent years, many researchers have focussed on the development of advanced EM strategies for MG to establish a self-sustained MG. Therefore, a comparative study is required to have a 360\u00b0 view of the domain EM in MGs. In this regard, this article presents a critical and comparative analysis of the EM strategies developed for the MG's optimal decision-making along with their demand response strategies. The broader classification of EMS based on supervisory control, operating time platform, and an approach for making a decision is discussed along with their limitations and solutions. To manage the dynamic and intermittent nature of RERs and load, different uncertainty handling and modeling approaches are summarized. A systematic review strategy consists of some tasks is adopted by the authors, for example (i) Extraction of research articles related to EM in MG; (ii) Filtering out the important articles to prepare a relevant research article database (iii) Critically analyzing the EM strategy developed in each article. In a broader perspective, this paper presents an up-to-date systematic analysis of EM strategies for MGs developed by various researchers.

Moreover, demand-side management (DSM) as a tool is employed to reduce the operating cost of the power system.

Minimizing the total operating cost of the system is considered as the objective function of this problem. Problem constraints include operating and executive constraints for load shifting. Finally, the model is solved using the developed adolescent identity search algorithm (AISA).

As a result, meeting this increased demand requires a proportional rise in fuel use to generate energy. This type of conventional power production has significant impacts on the environment. The eco-friendly alternative is the use of renewable energies in its distributed form on buildings.

There is, however, great uncertainty associated with the achievable levels of heat decarbonisation and the optimal heat technology mix, which can have serious implications for the future electricity and gas demand. This work employs an integrated gas, electricity and heat supply model to quantify the impacts of heat decarbonisation pathways on the future electricity and gas demand. A case study in the Great Britain is performed considering two heat decarbonisation scenarios in 2050: one is the predominantly electrified heat supply and the other is the predominantly hydrogen-based heat supply. The electricity demand becomes more volatile in the electrified heat scenario as the peak surges to 107.3 GW compared to 51.1 GW in the 2018 reference scenario, while the peak in hydrogen-based heat scenario is 78.4 GW. The peak gas demand declines from 247.6 GW for 2018 to 81.7 GW for electrified heat scenario and to 85.1 GW for hydrogen-based heat scenario, confirming that the seasonality associated with heat demand is shifting away from the gas network and towards electricity network. Moreover, a sensitivity analysis shows that the future electricity demand is highly sensitive to parameters such as relative heat demand, coefficient of performance of air source heat pumps and share of electricity in hydrogen production. Finally, the application of a load shifting strategy demonstrates that demand-side flexibility has the potential to maintain the electricity system balance and minimise the generation and network infrastructure requirements arising from heat electrification. While the case study presented in this paper is based on the Great Britain, the findings regarding the future electricity and gas demand are relevant for the global energy transition. \u00a9 2022 The Authors", "2022"]

Both these algorithms are comprised of 'two-step'. The number of time-slots to be considered in each iteration is decided in first step. In second step, the solution for considered time-slots is obtained through a non-cooperative game-theoretic approach using the proximal decomposition algorithm (PDA). An investigation is carried out to establish the existence and multiplicity of Nash equilibrium for the formulated game. The convergence of PDA has a strong dependency on system parameters and is unique for a system. Hence an analysis is performed to derive the convergence criteria for the formulated problem. The system model includes distributed energy storage, distributed dispatchable generation, time-shiftable, power-shiftable (PSD), and essential devices. The reduction in power consumption of PSD caused due to the optimization process creates discomfort to users. Therefore, we have incorporated an objective to minimize the discomfort and reduce consumers' energy bills. Simulation is carried out to show the efficacy of developed algorithms in terms of the energy bill, peak reduction, and solution time.

A data-driven distributionally robust optimization (DDRO) methodology is used to solve the proposed mean-risk portfolio optimization model. The participation of a battery in DSM along with day-ahead and real-time markets (e.g., energy, spinning reserve, regulation up, and regulation down) faces uncertainties in market-clearing prices, energy demand, and available power capacity. Since in this application, the distribution of the uncertain parameters is only observable through a finite training dataset, the proposed DDRO methodology uses the Wasserstein metric to construct a ball in the space of probability distributions, which is centered at the uniform distribution on the training samples. Then, based on the worst-case distribution within this Wasserstein ball, it seeks decisions that perform best. The proposed DDRO problem over Wasserstein balls is reformulated as a finite convex problem, tested, and verified using real market data and supply/demand profiles. The results are compared with the ones obtained from other optimization methods, including deterministic and classical stochastic optimization, which validates the high performance of the proposed DDRO over finite historical sample data. \u00a9 2022", "2022"]

Therefore, by studying the source-load interaction problem of the regional integrated energy system, this paper conducts energy supply and demand side management, which achieve lean control of regional loads. First of all, based on the time-varying characteristics of the distributed load in the region, cluster the loads and analyze the supply and demand trends for clusters. After that, considering the production process parameters, decentralized autonomous control is implemented for the cluster time-varying load.

The proposed DPUTB integrated geothermal heat pump system is an original innovation that enables Grid-interactive Energy Efficient buildings. This paper focuses on the study of the novel DPUTB. The DPUTB works as both a thermal storage tank (an inner tank) and a ground heat exchanger (an outer tank separated from the inner tank by the insulation material). High fidelity and computationally effective models are needed to predict the performance of the novel DPUTB. This study has developed a simplified dynamic model for the DPUTB according to heat transfer and energy conservation principles and validated it by using experimental data obtained from testing a small-scale DPUTB apparatus. A parametric study was conducted to identify a design that can achieve the target thermal storage performance of load shift and energy efficiency. The parametric study results show that the inner tank shell thermal conductivity and the phase change material's melting point are the two most influencing factors on the performance of the DPUTB.

However, consumer-side market participants, especially large energy consumers, remain passive actors in electricity markets and have little or no market participation strategy. Therefore, this paper aims to examine the alignment status between market liberalisation properties and industrial consumer participation criteria, and investigate the influence of market design and market intervention on consumer-side market participation. A multi-criteria market participation suitability evaluation is proposed for the examination and investigation of two electricity markets, the Nordic region and China. The results show that the more liberalised Nordic electricity market provides good participation incentives for cost savings but fails to address other criteria such as financial security or ease of adoption; the more regulated and less competitive submarkets in the Chinese market provide less opportunities for strategic cost savings but are easier to adopt and give consumers better long-term financial overviews. In general, market context strongly influences the preferred market type for consumer participation. Nonetheless, market intervention is essential to ensure consumer-side market participation, irrespective of the stage of liberalisation. The required amount of market intervention depends amongst others on the type of submarket, and the service it provides to the grid.

To participate, end-users must weigh potential revenues against their primary objectives, subject to their operational constraints. This work presents a technology-neutral framework to simultaneously determine the optimal operation, flexibility bids and prices by extending original operation planning problems into two-stage stochastic ones. Recovery constraints are introduced to exclude potentially adverse bids. As case studies, diverse residential end-users, who minimize their cost and additionally place flexibility bids, are analyzed. The results reveal complex time-varying and system-specific dynamics of bid volumes and prices. For example, heating systems receiving flat electricity rates can effortlessly bid flexibility from forcing early heat generation, namely, positive flexibility for combined heat and power units and negative flexibility for heat pumps. However, under time-varying rates, bid patterns change and become synchronized, which can cause scarcity in markets with homogeneous participants. With this framework, end-users can assess technical and economic potentials, plan their operations and market participation.

While a recent, growing body of the literature has conclusively shown the effectiveness of multi-carrier microgrids in improving the business cases of localized energy solutions with high penetrations of renewables, the potential benefits associated with interconnecting neighboring multi-carrier microgrids to form networked systems are less well-explored.

Here conceptualised as a niche innovation within the Danish socio-technical district heating landscapes, the research explores potentials and limitations of this building energy flexibility strategy from the perspective of district heating sector professionals, actors at the centre of the low-carbon energy transitions. Results of the mixed-methods abductive research enquiry suggest that this energy flexibility strategy facilitates (I) solving local network congestion challenges in smaller parts of existing networks and (II) reduces needed network capacity in new heat supply areas. Sector professionals assess this (III) energy flexibility strategy as most practicable in large-scale/commercial buildings and industries. Challenges include hardware balancing, service and maintenance, and the sometimes counterproductive incentive structures among stakeholders involved. Research evidence suggests that business models appealing to environmental values and priorities may incentivise sustainable heat-use behaviours more than economic benefit alone among some groups of end users.

The stochastic and high charging load of EVs results in a non-negligible challenge that may cause grid overload. A promising approach is the participation of charging stations in demand response as load aggregators by coordinating the charging power of electric vehicles. However, improper coordination of charging load may lead to unfulfilled charging demand, which would cause dissatisfaction on the demand side. In this study, the incentive-based and time-varying demand response mechanism is considered when charging stations coordinate charging of multiple EVs. A decentralized decision-making framework is innovatively applied to provide charging power of each EV. The charging process is modeled as a Markov decision process, and a virtual price is designed to help decide the charging power. Deep reinforcement learning algorithms such as deep deterministic policy gradient are applied to determine the charging strategy of multiple and heterogeneous EVs. Numerical experiments are performed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. A comparison with an optimal charging strategy and a heuristic rule-based method shows that the proposed method can trade off the revenue from demand response and user satisfaction, as well as reduce the peak load of the charging station. Furthermore, a test with inaccurate departure information indicates the robustness of the proposed method. \u00a9 2022", "2022"]

It is assumed that the control integration of a novel thermochemical seasonal energy storage concept into a building energy system can meet this requirement and save operating costs. For this purpose, a model-predictive control concept with a prediction horizon beyond that of public weather forecasts is crucial. A state-based model is developed consisting of a building, a water buffer and a heat supply. To assess the effects of seasonal storage, different heat supply configurations are considered. On this basis, two Model Predictive Control (MPC) concepts are designed to efficiently operate the system over one year. Since public weather forecasts are reliable in the time range of several days, test reference year data are used to approximate the weather forecast beyond the public forecast period. Additionally, the control hierarchy is comprised of a superordinate optimal generation scheduling (OGS) and a subordinate MPC. The concepts follow the scheduled long-term lime storage trajectory and realise possible short-term yields based on the current public forecast. The trajectory tracking is formulated either in the objective function or the constraints. The integration of the novel lime storage module into the heat supply of a building allows a reduction of operating costs of 18% in the realistic scenario and up to 80% in case of highly fluctuating electricity prices. This reduction potential is fully exploited by the developed control approaches, but it is very sensitive to the change of the controller parameters, the fluctuation of the electricity price and the weather data. Moreover, by applying the objective-based reference tracking approach, the higher-level scheduling hierarchy could be avoided. Through the results of this work, it is confirmed that the integration of a seasonal energy storage system can greatly reduce annual operating costs and that it is not crucial to apply a prediction horizon beyond that of public forecasts. \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.", "2022"]

It is characterized by a bidirectional flow of information and energy between consumers and suppliers. However, the rapid increase of energy demands in residential areas is becoming a challenging problem. In order to address this issue, Demand-Side Management (DSM) has proven to be an effective solution. In this paper, we propose LOSISH, a price-based Demand Response (DR) system for load scheduling in residential Smart Homes (SHs) that achieves a trade-off between electricity payments and consumer's discomfort. Our proposed system considers Renewable Energy Sources (RESs), Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) and Plug-in Electric Vehicle (PEV). We formulate our scheduling as a constrained optimization problem and we propose a new hybrid algorithm to solve it. The latter combines two well known heuristic algorithms: Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Binary Particle Swarm Optimization (BPSO). Moreover, we propose a new clustering algorithm based on Machine Learning (ML) to extract consumer's preferences from a real dataset that contains the historical consumption patterns of his smart appliances. We test our approach on real data traces obtained from a SH and we set up an experiment to evaluate our algorithm on a Raspberry Pi and measure its energy consumption. To prove the effectiveness of our approach, we compare our results with another approach from the literature in terms of electricity bill, Peak-to-Average Ratio (PAR), energy consumption, and execution time. Numerical results show that LOSISH outperforms the other approach in terms of electricity bill (up to 52.92% cheaper), PAR (up to 44% decrease in peak demands), energy consumption (up to 69.44% less consumption), and execution time (up to 63.15% faster). \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd", "2022"]

Transformation of the power system \u2013 decentralization and prosumerism has led to the spread of domestic power plants taking part in the process. Mismatch problem of these predominantly grid-connected systems are typically described with load matching indicators. Most commonly used self-consumption and self-sufficiency metrics, though come with limits. One of the greatest is that they are monotone as the function of the capacity of photovoltaics implemented, making them uncapable of suggesting a technical optimum for system size. The scope of this study is to introduce two novel indicators with technical optima those can serve as a sizing principle for domestic photovoltaic plants for different approaches. First, self-production metric is introduced which allocates photovoltaic capacity that delivers maximum renewable utilization on-site and second, grid-liability reveals an optimum from the perspective of minimizing grid usage. A reference building is studied with two control approaches to observe both the existing and indicators. As a base scenario, a water heater with classical control is simulated, while in the second case, demand side management is achieved via improved rule-based control, aiming to store surplus photovoltaic power production. Simulations reveal that the optimum capacity of the photovoltaics from the perspective of both self-production and grid-liability is much lower than the capacity (of 6.57 kWp) that would cover the annual electricity demands of the observed household. In case of the traditional control, self-production leads to an optimal photovoltaic capacity of 4.38 kWp, while grid-liability to a 0.73 kWp. With improved control, optimal capacities are much closer, 2.92 and 2.19 kWp respectively. \u00a9 2022 The Author(s)", "2022"]

In addition, advancements in demand-side management can help strengthen distribution network stability. A viable approach is to develop local flexibility markets (LFMs) to aggregate prosumer flexibility potentials and offer grid ancillary services. To facilitate such prosumer\u2013market interactions, an open-source model, named OpenTUMFlex is developed in this study to quantify and price prosumer flexibility. The core of this model is an energy management system that optimizes prosumer data to obtain a cost-optimal operation schedule. Flexibility potential is defined as all possible deviations from this optimal operation without violating device constraints. Flexibility services are characterized as positive and negative flexibility based on the energy exchanged with the grid. Also, a predictive pricing mechanism is introduced to identify the minimum price the prosumer needs to be compensated for their flexibility service. The outcome of this model is a flexibility offer table using which the prosumer can bid in the LFMs. An iterative interaction between the OpenTUMFlex model and LFM is possible as the model integrates the flexibility service requirements from the selected bid into its operational schedule and generates a new optimal operation schedule with renewed flexibility offers. The model is analyzed using two case studies where a sample flexibility service implementation for different prosumer devices is discussed. In addition, a unique flexibility representation technique is introduced to illustrate the flexibility offers graphically.

Coordinated and controlled operation of these renewable energy sources (RESs) with conventional sources is required to meet this requirement. The ancillary services arising due to uncertain RESs and loads can be managed better if RESs connected in a microgrid (MG) which has the provision of monitoring, control, demand response (DR), and storage in it. This paper proposes and demonstrates the role of a microgrid in providing the ancillary services support to the grid considering the demand response program (DRP). Netload variations are captured during load scheduling considering the DR contribution and aggregated netload of the prosumers. Participants of the DRP receive incentives based on the power curtailment during scheduling. The system performance has been investigated with and without DR and commitment of the microgrid to support the utility grid (UG) considering different types of consumer loads (i.e. Shiftable, controllable and curtailable). The incentives to the consumers, availability of storage system along with power trading regulations impact their contribution in ancillary service support to the system.

Demand Response (DR) is an approach to DSM that aims to influence the operation times of appliances; DR is often recommended for residences. Meanwhile, residents can undermine DR if it is not convenient. Therefore, there is need for tools to aid decision-making on the appropriate DR program for residences. Whilst models are used to explore DR programs, most do not measure, visualise or analyse the convenience of residents, although some models make assumptions about convenience. This paper explores convenience of a residence as timeliness by simulating four scenarios of DR programs in a single residence, using the System Dynamics (SD) methodology. In addition to delay in appliance-use that may result from DR, two indicators of convenience are proposed that consider preferences of the residence: Delay Duration Profile (DDP) and Delay Time Profile (DTP). When comparing convenience as delay, it was found that more hours of DR is better than less, earlier hours (from occupancy period) are better, and splitting or distributing DR hours during the day is better than being contiguous. Similar findings apply to DDP and DTP. Furthermore, it was found that DR leads to monetary savings and reduction in daily peak demand.

Concerning inhibitory forces, first, the frequent maintenance of biodigesters is found to be the most significant. Second, the long payback period is exposed to be a critical inhibitory force. Third, the lack of ease of access to biogas-based local markets and the inaccessibility of experts are indicated as significant inhibitory forces. Moreover, the complications in handling the new technology, inadequate incentives, applicability to limited energy appliances, reconstruction of houses, drop in efficiency, escalated installation cost, and energy supply insufficiency are established to be vital inhibitory forces of Bio-Tech acceptance at the respondent level. \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd", "2022"]

Accordingly, this article proposes a user-oriented multi-objective approach, which minimizes energy costs and maximizes consumer privacy. In addition, a home energy management system is suggested for smart homes to optimize the energy consumption pattern of appliances. On the other hand, considering challenges in energy management of smart homes, the concept of demand-side management (DSM) is introduced. The objective of the proposed method is to reduce energy consumption to lower consumers' electricity bills. Also, it improves user comfort (UC) in average waiting time conditions. In this research, a smart home equipped with an energy management system and smart home appliances that can inject electric power into the upstream network is considered the main system. This framework leads to a multi-objective optimization problem in which the two objectives mentioned above are considered two separate dimensions. To solve the problem, an ITS-BF Algorithm is used, which employs a random search to schedule home appliances and batteries based on the application of flexible devices in smart homes. The case studies show that the proposed method can considerably respect and satisfy users' privacy and reduce the energy cost to an acceptable level. Finally, the numerical results obtained from the simulation have been analyzed to evaluate the proposed method's efficiency. The simulation results show that an ITS-BF algorithm performs better than the existing methods in reducing costs and waiting time.  \u00a9 2022 Amir Ali Dashtaki et al.", "2022"]

However, both these applications and SMR siting issues for power systems have multiple complexities that have been difficult to be considered in past studies. Accordingly, an optimization-aided small modular reactor siting (OASS) model is initiated in this study to support decisions of siting, sizing, and timing for small modular reactor (SMR) development. The proposed OASS model is specialized for obtaining possible SMRs siting schemes, wind-SMRs combination schemes, and power system transition schemes with coal plant closure and SMRs deployment. This research initiates the application of an optimization-based modelling approach to tackle SMRs site selection issues for Saskatchewan, Canada. The results disclose that electricity imports and natural gas power will fill the electricity demand gap in Saskatchewan's power system in the short term. Results obtained from this model can also identify optimized patterns of SMRs and wind farms deployment and siting in Saskatchewan. Power stations with large capacity and independent transmission grid will become the primary choice in the SMRs and wind farms site selection process. Such patterns and alternatives would enable decision-makers obtain optimized energy structure by introducing SMR reflecting trade-offs between overall system costs and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from both economic and environmental perspectives. \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd", "2022"]

This paper presents a new approach to optimal design of a day-ahead pricing mechanism for managing distribution network congestion caused by renewable generation. The proposed concept of day-ahead pricing is designed to minimize customer electricity bills taking account of line power constraints resulting from increased penetration of renewable generation. It is assumed that each user is equipped with controllable appliances and a smart meter enabling two-way communications between suppliers and their customers. Suppliers employ an hourly demand side management strategy which considers the price signal from distribution network operators (DNOs), distributed generations (DGs) and wholesale market. A weighted average DUoS charge approach is applied in this paper, allowing DNOs to send a cost reflective use of system charge to electricity users in different locations based on their hourly predicted day-ahead power consumption. An optimum day-ahead pricing mechanism has been developed for DGs to manage their renewable resources to achieve revenue reconciliation and maximize generation output. Finally, power suppliers can optimally manage the controllable appliances that installed in each end user and balance the energy consumption from the main grid and DGs to minimize the electricity price. Several case studies have been conducted with a modified IEEE-33 bus distribution network, where a large-scale nonlinear optimization programming algorithm is applied to solve the problem. \u00a9 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.", "2021"]

Nevertheless, the classic current sizing methods for such networks only consider the total demand, and not the possible loads after use of such techniques. The present paper aim is so to ascertain the connection between the possible demand reductions and the capacity design of generation sources. The study proposes an iterative sizing method with demand-side management as the central pillar. It retro-fits production units by assessing the network's overall performance through several criteria, both energetic and economical and with operational considerations. Exergy, which accounts for the quality of energy and is especially useful for multi-energy networks, is also considered. The method is illustrated on a mixed grid coupling a standalone heating network with a local electrical grid. Thousands of residential dwellings, with haphazard demands covered by solar-assisted technologies and a heat-pump are used in a series of ten scenarios with various management strategies, pricing policies and types of end-user contracts. In summary, the iterative method reduced the number of installed solar thermal collectors and photovoltaic panels by 13\u201338 % and 8\u201330 %, respectively. Furthermore, the method is stable: results converged after 2 iterations, in all scenarios.

Despite solar energy being clean and abundant for building heating, it has a temporal mismatch issue in which the energy demand and provision are opposite in magnitude between the heating and non-heating seasons. This paper propounds an energy management strategy, which aims to use year-round solar energy efficiently by producing heat in the heating season and generating electricity from the non-heating season's solar residual energy. The results prove that it can meet most of the space heating demand of the target district and provide extra electricity in the non-heating season. The year-round solar effective utilization duration is elevated to 2.48-fold of the conventional solar heating project and the annual thermal energy storage efficiency of 91.22% manifests that solar energy can be utilized more efficiently than the seasonal storage system (< 60%) throughout the whole year. Furthermore, the life cycle cost analysis indicates that the unit energy cost of this system (0.102 \u20ac/kWh) is lower than the solar seasonal energy storage system. Therefore, the solar energy supply-demand mismatch problem is settled via this energy management strategy and it is prospective to be promoted worldwide in the future. \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd", "2022"]

One of the most important is the so-called response fatigue, which refers to the discouragement experienced by consumers when they received an excessive number of signals from the operator. This circumstance is, however, typically ignored in energy management tools of electrical energy systems. To solve this issue, this paper proposes an uncertainty-aware day-ahead optimal scheduling tool for grid-connected microgrids based on information gap decision theory, which incorporates additional constraints to bound the duration of demand response signals. Thereby, the harmful effects caused by response fatigue are lessened. The developed optimization problem is formulated as a Mixed-Integer-Linear programming, which is solvable using standard solvers and versatile enough to be adapted to different system layouts. A benchmark case study serves to show the effectiveness of the developed methodology to manage with uncertainties, while the effect of response fatigue in consumers is bounded to acceptable thresholds. As a sake of example, the developed methodology is able to determine a scheduling plan with a total renewable generation 50% lower compared with the deterministic case, while the total demand is overestimated by \u223c20%, in which the effect of response fatigue is kept within acceptable bounds yet.

The complexity is rooted in the many decision criteria such as technology, brand reputation, energy capacity, volume, weight, aging, and warranty among many others. As such, for non-expert users, particularly small households or enterprises, the act of energy storage adoption is becoming growingly cumbersome. To address this problem, this paper introduces a decision support tool for the evaluation of commercial (small-scale) energy storage products. It then identifies the most suitable option(s) based on the users' preferences. For the reasons elaborated in the paper, nine multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methodologies have been employed. Altogether, 19 attributes are identified for the evaluation of (battery) energy storage technologies. The decision support tool is developed in the Matlab environment and includes a graphical user interface for easier interaction of non-expert users. For the demonstration, three scenario cases have been studied for users with different preferences. The ranking results clearly show the marked impact of users preferences on the recommended energy storage technologies.

Yet, they are also excellent candidates for demand-response since they possess readily controllable operations and large amounts of storage.

A series of case studies comparing different user interface designs were undertaken to investigate domestic Demand Response (DR) in relation to automated washing appliances and their effects on occupants. Focus groups were used to inform the study design and to cross-validate case study findings. The aim was to identify factors that may influence adoption and implementation of DR, in particular incentives and feedback methods. The results highlighted the importance of the intrinsic features of the controlled appliances as well as the wider social and physical environments they were operated in. The dynamics within households with limited resources, such as time and space, meant that convenience was key regarding DR system adoption, whilst financial incentives were suitable for initial user attraction. Dynamic pricing, commonly featured in DSM systems, was also shown to stress household practices and to cause both, efficient and inefficient energy use, if coupled with automation. Furthermore, the agency, clarity and reliability of control and feedback mechanisms were found to be crucial with regards to DR acceptance.

However, TABS are generally incorporated into the building during the construction phase, limiting their adoption to new buildings. To encourage the application of TABS during building refurbishments, the authors have developed a radiant ceiling panel (RCP) with macroencapsulated phase change materials (PCM). This study aims to provide the criteria to design, size, and control the newly proposed RCP-PCM system. A simplified method to size and design the RCP-PCM system for cooling applications is developed from a set of parametric dynamic simulations. At first, the thermal storage properties of the macro-encapsulated PCM were determined using the standard ASTM C1784-20. The obtained properties were then used in a whole-building simulation model validated using measurements in a small test chamber that replicates the conditions of an actual test room. The PCM panel thickness of 0.015 m and a supply water temperature of 15 \u2103 showed the best results in terms of thermal comfort and effective thermal energy storage capacity. The implementation of the simplified method in a case study showed that the RCP-PCM system maintained room conditions within the specified thermal comfort range (\u22120.5 < PMV < 0.5) for more than 90% of the occupied periods in all of the evaluated cooling-dominated climates.

This result is robust to alternative ways to addressing endogeneity, alternative specifications and other checks. We also find that Locus of Control, income, hours worked, and social capital are channels through which Protestantism lowers the likelihood of being in energy poverty. Our findings shed new light on how cultural, and specifically religious, beliefs influence the proclivity to be in energy poverty and may assist policymakers to identify ways to help reduce the incidence of energy poverty. \u00a9 2022", "2022"]

As a result, the utility (electricity supplier) faces difficulties in maintaining the balance between supply and demand. Further, such supply and demand imbalance leads to frequent load-shedding and a drop in power quality (PQ), predominantly in the developing world. Increasing consumer awareness of energy consumption and implementing efficient demand-side management (DSM) algorithms in a metering instrument can be utilized to avoid such issues. Nowadays, access to the internet in developing nations is increasing rapidly. Hence to solve the existing limitations, the internet of things (IoT)-based smart meter (SM) is proposed and its practical application demonstrated in households in Bangladesh as a case study. The proposed SM primarily serves local and online monitoring, bidirectional data transmission, and DSM at the consumer side by maintaining PQ and peak-clipping. The MySql cloud database is used here for data storage and bidirectional data transmission between consumers and the utility. Web applications are developed for real-time data visualization, enabling consumers to track their hourly, daily, and monthly energy consumption by accessing the web page. The SM data shows that the over-voltage varied (from a nominal 220 V) within 15.45\u201316.36%, and the under-voltage varied between 10.45% and 11.82% from 220 V. The frequency fluctuations are found to be 2.2% under and 2.4% over the nominal value of 50 Hz (standard is nominal value \u00b1 1%). The experimental result showed that the proposed IoT-based SM could ensure the smooth operation of electrical home appliances by maintaining PQ-related parameters (voltage and frequency) within a standard limit. Additionally, the proposed SM also helps to maintain the maximum pre-defined demand of a household during peak times through an appropriate load-clipping algorithm. The utility company can remotely define peak time hours and maximum peak demands when necessary. The real-life demonstration of the SM's operation advocated that this type of IoT-based SM could be easily adapted to maintain the balance between supply and demand through DSM application, and increase consumers' awareness of energy consumption in developing countries. \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd", "2022"]

On the demand side, distributed multi-energy systems with process industry (DMSPI) composed of the district energy supply system (DESS) and the process industry load (PIL) have tremendous potential to provide flexibility for the accommodation of more renewable energy. However, there is little study on the flexibility exploration and characterization of the DMSPI, hindering the utilization of such flexible resources by system operators. To address the problem, this paper proposes a projection-based method to evaluate the integrated flexible region (IFR) of the DMSPI considering the energy conversion in the DESS and production adjustment in the PIL. First, an energy-material integrated model based on the energy hub (EH) is proposed to couple the material flows of the PIL and the energy flows of the DESS. In the proposed model, the production target constraints of the PIL and energy interaction constraints of the DESS are considered. Moreover, the integrated flexibility of the DMSPI is mathematically expressed and defined as the IFR based on the polytopic projection. A calculation method based on vertex enumeration is proposed to find the IFR of the DMSPI. Case studies illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method to explore the IFR of the DMSPI. The results show that the energy conversion and the adjustable production process endow the DMSPI with a substantial ability to convert and shift its multi-energy demand to provide flexibility for system operation. \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd", "2022"]

In this paper, we optimize a range of RES configurations considering different combinations of solar, wind, battery and pumped hydro storage for a specific location under diverse flexibility scenarios: one of load shifting (flexibility of power demand by changing consumption patterns by 0\u201330%), one of small load loss/shedding (0\u20135%), and one of both.

A few large power plants feed the power grid and the aim is to ensure that the demand and supply are always balanced. The traditional energy management schemes in a grid are aimed towards energy system optimization. Although there is considerable experience with the optimization of energy production and distribution, researchers and industries are increasingly focused on the demand side. The reliable operation of a grid demands the electricity supply and load demand to be constantly and precisely balanced in real-time. However, it is difficult to achieve this balance since both supply and demand could change unexpectedly and significantly due to intermittent power surge/drop from Renewable Energy Resources (RES), sudden load changes, and forced outages in generation units or other components of the power grid. In such scenarios, Demand Side Management (DSM) in addition to generation control can help to manage and match the customer load with the supply system.

Due to the increasing progress of science and human communities and the rise in air pollutants and Earth temperature, the need for renewable energies and electric vehicles has increased. The only challenge to the use of new energies is the uncertainty in their production due to the lack of continuous solar irradiation and wind in different hours of the day.

In this paper, we develop a modeling framework consisting of an optimization for prosumer home energy management systems embedded in a local energy market simulation. To enable an integrated assessment, the local market is linked to a central spot market. For each prosumer, we consider the individual flexibility potential, home storage systems, and demand response of electric vehicles. Using this model, we analyze the costs and benefits of a local market for prosumers in an energy system with a high share of renewable energy. We compare the systemic effects and the potential economic benefits of this local market for prosumers to pure self-consumption and prosumer participation in a central spot market. Applying our model to a case study of 480 prosumers, we show that a system including a local market is beneficial compared to self-consumption from a systemic perspective. However, allowing prosumers to participate directly in a central spot market is more profitable and facilitates the system integration of renewables. \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd", "2022"]

All of which require knowledge of the building dynamics in order to effectively perform. However, the scaling-up of building modelling approaches is still, as of today, a recurrent challenge in the field. The heterogeneous building stock makes it tedious to tailor interpretable approaches in a scalable way. This work puts forward an automated and scalable method for stochastic model identification of building heat dynamics, implemented on a set of 247 Dutch residential buildings. From established models and selection approach, automation extensions were proposed along with a novel residual auto-correlation indicator, i.e., normalized Cumulated Periodogram Boundary Excess Sum (nCPBES), to classify obtained model fits. Out of the available building stock, 93 building heat dynamics models were identified as good fits, 95 were classified as close and 59 were designed as poor. The identified model parameters were leveraged to estimate thermal characteristics of the buildings to support building energy benchmarking, in particular, building envelope insulation performance. To encourage the dissimination of the work and assure reproducibility, the entire code base can be found on Github along with an example data set of 3 anonymized buildings. The presented method takes an important step towards the automation of building modeling approaches in the sector. It allows the development of applications at large-scale, enhancing building performance benchmarks, boosting city-scale building stock scenario modeling and assisting end-use load identifications as well as building energy flexibility potential estimation. \u00a9 2022 The Author(s)", "2022"]

Furthermore, there has been an increase in the integration of renewable energy sources in the electric grid. Hence, one needs to manage the energy consumption needs of the consumers, more effectively. Consumers can connect all the devices and houses to the internet by using Internet of Things (IoT) technology.

The HEMS organise the controllable appliances after taking into consideration the user preferences, electricity prices and the amount of energy produced /stored. The set of optimal consumption schedules for every HEMS was estimated using a BPSO and BSA. On the other hand, Stage 2 includes a Multi-Agent-System (MAS) based on the IoT.

In this study, we propose a novel approach based on the conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN) and moving average method to generate sub-item load profiles of building energy consumption to solve the aforementioned problems. Sub-item load profiles include light and socket load, HVAC (Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning) load, impetus load and special load. The CGAN algorithm is employed to generate sub-item load profiles considering specific conditions (multiple labels) e.g. time, weather, and load shape labels. In addition, the moving average method was used to reduce noise in the generated profiles. The case study was conducted based on real-world sub-item load data collected from office buildings, commercial buildings, and hospitals in Shenzhen, China. We validated the generation performance of the sub-item load profile of CGAN-MA by comparing it with the traditional load profile generation method GAN and variational autoencoder based on three aspects: similarity, variability and diversity. Compared with the traditional model, the proposed model improves the similarity and variability by about 5.7% to 64.8%, 76.7% to 135.5% respectively, and can satisfy the requirements of diversity with the diversity indicator of four sub item generated load is 1.36, 1.93, 1.81 and 2.08 respectively. Furthermore, we compared the generated load and real load possibility distributions under the selected conditions. The results show that the load generated by CGAN-MA is higher on working days, rainy days and hot days than on non-working days, sunny days and cool days, which correspond to the real circumstances, and sub-item B (HVAC) is the most sensitive one to different conditions.

A reward-based demand response program is considered in the proposed framework to realize demand-side management and boost the economic performance of the MMG system. Besides, conditional value-at-risk as a proper risk-averse index is incorporated into the developed mixed-integer programming formulation to hedge the risk of the low profits associated with worst scenarios.

Accordingly, this research uses the Markov-switching panel vector autoregressive model to cover the knowledge gap by exploring how energy trilemma is affected in large energy-users through (i) complexity-based policies, e.g., sharing economy and economic complexity, and (ii) resource-portfolio-decision policies, e.g., \u201cdiversification of primary energy demand and supply\u201d, switching to \u201cnon-carbon-based fuel portfolio\u201d, and energy prices.

However, the majority of the existing models suffer from performance degradation during the prediction process. This paper presents a new strategy that integrates Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) models and Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents to forecast building next-day electricity consumption and peak electricity demand. In this strategy, LSTM models were first developed and trained using the historical data as the base models for prediction. RL agents were further constructed and introduced to learn a policy that can dynamically tune the parameters of the LSTM models according to the prediction error. This strategy was tested using the electricity consumption data collected from a group of university buildings and student accommodations. The results showed that for the student accommodations which showed relatively large monthly variations in daily electricity consumption, the proposed strategy can increase the prediction accuracy by up to 23.5% as compared with the strategy using the LSTM models only. However, when it was applied to the buildings with insignificant monthly variations in the daily electricity consumption, the prediction accuracy did not show an obvious improvement when compared with the use of the LSTM models alone.

Appliance shifting techniques have proved to be an effective demand response strategy in load reduction. The purpose of this paper is therefore to help consumers of electricity understand when and how they can shift some appliances from peak to off-peak and vice versa. Design/methodology/approach: The research uses an analysis technique of Richardson et al. (2010). In their survey on time-of-use surveys to determine the usage of electricity in households as far as appliance shifting was concerned, this study allowed for the assessment of how the occupants\u2019 daily activities in households affect residential electricity consumption. Fell et al. (2014) modeled an aggregate of electricity demand using different appliances (n) in the household. The data for the peak time used in this study were identified from 05:00 to 08:00 and 17:00 to 21:00 for testing the load shifting algorithms, and the off-peak times were pecked from 10:00 to 16:00 and 23:00. This study technique used load management considering real-time scheduling for peak levels in the selected homes. The household devices are modeled in terms of controlled parameters. Using this study\u2019s time-triggered loads on refrigerators and air conditioning systems, the findings suggested that peak loads can be reduced to 45% as a means of maintaining the simultaneous quality of service. To minimize peak loads to around 35% or more, Chaiwongsa and Wongwises (2020) have indicated that room air conditioning and refrigerator loads are simpler to move compared to other household appliances such as cooking appliances. Yet in conclusion, this study made a strong case that a decrease in household peak demand for electricity is primarily contingent on improvements in human behavior. Findings: This study has shown that appliance load shifting is a very good way of reducing electrical consumption in residential homes. The comparative performance shows a moderate reduction of 1% in load as was found in the work done by Laicaine (2014). The results, however, indicate that load shifting to a large extent can be achieved by consumer behavioral change. The main response to this study is to advise policymakers in Ghana to develop the appropriate demand response and consumer education towards the general reduction in electrical load in domestic households. The difficulty, however, is how to get the attention of consumer\u2019s on how to start using appliances with less load at peak and also shift some appliances from off-peak times. By increasing consumer knowledge and participation in demand response, it is possible to achieve more efficiency and flexibility in load reduction. The findings were benchmarked with existing comparison studies but may benefit from the potential production of structured references. However, the findings show that load shifting can only be done by modifying consumer actions. Research limitations/implications: It should be remembered that this study showed that the use of appliances shifting in residential homes results in load reduction benefits for customers, expressed as savings in electricity prices. The next step will be to build on this cost/benefit study to explain and measure how these reductions transform into net consumer gains for all Ghanaian households. Practical/implications: Load shifting will include load controllers in the future, which would automatically handle electricity consumption from various appliances in the home. Based on the device and user needs, the controllers can prioritize loads and appliance usage. The algorithms that underpin automatic load controllers will include knowledge about the behaviors of groups of end users. The results on the time dependency of activities may theoretically inform the algorithms of automatic demand controllers.

This makes it crucial for prosumers to increase self-consumption and size their photovoltaic (PV) and battery energy storage system (BESS) units accordingly. Self-consumption can be increased through demand-side management (DSM) and an efficient DSM can be achieved using home energy management systems (HEMSs). Therefore, as its main contribution, this study proposes an optimal PV-BESS sizing model for HEMS-equipped prosumers considering day-ahead load scheduling-based DSM. Unlike other studies in the literature, the proposed model takes into account the determination of optimal PV tilt angle, load scheduling of all types of controllable appliances (time-shiftable, thermostatically controllable, power-shiftable), consideration of battery degradation, and vehicle-to-home (V2H) availability in the sizing procedure. First, the mixed-integer linear programming (MILP)-based model performs demand response (DR) and increased self-consumption to minimize the daily bill. Second, it simulates one year of HEMS operation and determines the net present value (NPV) of a PV-BESS configuration over the system lifetime. Finally, it repeats the same process for each combination of PV capacity-PV tilt angle-battery number and chooses the combination with the highest NPV as the optimal design. The simulations were conducted to find the required PV-BESS capacity for a HEMS-equipped household with average daily electricity consumption of 37.5 kWh in Istanbul, Turkey. The optimal configuration was found to be 3 kW PV without BESS at the tilt angle of 10\u00b0. A techno-economic sizing comparison was made between households using and not using HEMS. The NPV of PV-BESS was found to be significantly higher with HEMS use ($2273) compared with that without HEMS use ($920).

MGs are a combination of different distributed generation resources (DGRs) which act as a controllable system at the distribution voltage level and supply power or heat to a group of local loads. Due to the high fluctuations of available power at the distribution voltage level, MGs may fail to supply major consumers. Therefore, several MGs are used by dividing consumers into smaller units; each unit is supplied by one MG. In this study, renewable sources such as wind turbine (WT), photovoltaic (PV) cell, and hydrogen storage system are considered as MGs. A novel energy management strategy is proposed using hydrogen storage system and considering uncertainties of renewable sources in the MG. This strategy aims to minimize the operating costs of batteries and hydrogen storage systems as well as unsupplied and surplus energy costs considering load supply constraints.

A transition to the V2G system enables EVs to flatten the load profile by shaving the peak demand and filling the valley demand by utilizing the unused/extra stored power in batteries to support the grid. Many authors have focused on shaving the peak demand with different methods like energy storage system (ESS) and demand-side management (DSM) and utilized various algorithms to assess the impacts of EVs and V2G system on shaving the peak demand. In most of these papers, only limited aspects of the implementation of V2G and its impacts on peak demand have been analyzed. In this paper, we propose a novel methodology to comprehensively evaluate the role of the EVs and V2G on shaving the peak demand and filling the valley demand under different parameters such as penetration level of EVs and V2G, charging mode, charging location, and schedule of charging. Monte Carlo simulation is utilized to analyze the influences of parameters on the power demand profile. The results indicate that un-controlled charging intensifies the peak demand up to 5% more than off-peak scenarios that negatively affect the grid's reliability. Among analyzed cases, integrating the EVs and V2G system under off-peak charging has better consequences in shaving the peak and filling the valley demand. The off-peak mode can level the load curve where the peak demand is decreased around 2%, and the valley demand is increased around 3%. Based on the outputs of the simulation, encouraging the EVs\u2019 owners to charge their electric batteries at late night or early morning would be the best policy to improve the power grid's performance. Charging at home would be a better option for leveling the load profile among all charging stations. Moreover, analysis indicates that there is a need for policies to regulate the schedule of charging at public stations. \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd", "2022"]

Demand side management in buildings plays a vital role in achieving this balance because buildings can provide grid services through a variety of building assets. However, the development of grid-interactive, efficient buildings is still in its infancy, and a systematic and holistic understanding of grid service delivery strategies in terms of energy efficiency, load shifting, load shedding and load modulating is still limited.

These issues can be addressed by an optimal energy-hub based planning framework considering the synergistic effects under multiple uncertainties. The energy hub model is extended to analyze energy-level matching and source\u2013load balance with time-varying coupling factors representing part-load characteristics. The optimization problem is formulated as a bi-level planning model with uncertainties evaluated by a two-stage global sensitivity analysis. The bi-level planning model determines the system structure and component sizing at the upper level and identifies the optimal operation strategy at the lower level by employing piecewise linearization of part-load characteristics of components involved. The global sensitivity analysis reduces model size with the elementary effect method, identifies the most influential uncertain parameters with a variance-based method. A case study in Beijing is demonstrated for the proposed methodology.

Being at the heart of a paradigm shift from passive users of the grid to active prosumers, storage owners and demand responsive actors, this paper expresses a flexible coordinated power system expansion planning (CPSEP) while considering local WFs, ESSs and incentive-based demand response programs (DRPs). This model minimizes the summation of the expansion planning, operation and reliability costs while taking the network model based on AC optimal power flow constraints, and the reliability and flexibility considerations into account.

However, the thermal storage capacity is limited by the available thermal mass as buildings are increasingly built using lightweight technologies. In addition, the structural thermal mass generally has a low heat storage and release rate, limiting the ability to manage building thermal loads. To overcome these limitations, we propose an innovative, flexible cooling system that can be installed in office buildings to replace conventional all-air systems. The system utilizes the high thermal energy storage capacity of macro-encapsulated phase change materials (PCM) discreetly incorporated below the serpentine copper coil of standard radiant ceiling panels (RCP). A walk-in dual climate chamber was used to evaluate experimentally the ability of the RCP-PCM system to shift cooling loads to off-peak hours. In addition, the heat removal capacity rate and the resulting indoor thermal environment improvements are assessed. The measured passive cooling power ranged between 11 W/m2 and 31.4 W/m2, with an average of around 17.3 W/m2. Results indicate that the RCP-PCM system can shift the cooling loads to off-peak hours while maintaining acceptable thermal comfort conditions during work hours (8:00 to 18:00). During the testing period, the system was able to passively absorb heat gains between 180 and 230 Wh/m2 during the day and operate actively only at night during unoccupied periods. This load-shifting capability of the RCP-PCM system can be of great help in planning DSM strategies for increased penetration of renewable electricity in building cooling applications. \u00a9 2022", "2022"]

The energy cost of an individual household is minimized under given assumptions on outside temperature, radiation, (dynamic) electricity price, and feed-in tariff.

However, to achieve this low-carbon goal, it would not be effective without appropriate incentives and the effective demand side involvement. Meanwhile, uncertainties in the system operation such as outputs of intermittent renewable energy, electric vehicles (EVs), and demand side behaviors introduce difficulty for scheduling, and further influence the system's carbon emission.

Resource-optimised management of district heating networks depends on a wide range of factors, including demand forecasting, operational flexibility, and increasingly volatile market conditions. However, traditional operations often still rely on static models and rather simple heuristics, while holistic optimisation requires dynamic cross-domain interoperability to allow the consideration of all these factors. This paper demonstrates a proof-of-concept for a knowledge graph based optimisation problem to minimise total heat generation cost for a district heating provider. The optimisation follows a hierarchical approach based on a merit-order principle and is embedded in a model predictive control framework to allow the system to incorporate most recent information and react to disturbances promptly. A detailed sensitivity study is conducted to identify key model parameters and assess the impact of anticipated changes in regulation and market conditions. Simulation-based optimisation is used to determine the short-term heat generation mix based on data-driven gas consumption models and day-ahead forecasts for the network's energy demand and grid temperatures. Seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average models with exogenous predictor variables are found to be sufficiently accurate and precise.

The proposed framework comprises a community-level power flow-based model to solve the energy procurement problem of the community and a building-level physics-aware simulation model to estimate a set of day-ahead aggregate load scenarios with potential joint-flexibilities. At the building-level, a least-cost multi-objective optimization provides a sequence of optimal temperature setpoints for all thermal zones that is fed into an accurate Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) to estimate heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) load trajectories while considering human comfort, occupancy patterns, building thermal response, and intraday electricity prices.

However, existing research rarely conducts comprehensive analysis on the multiple energy characteristics for the same building group simultaneously. Additionally, DSM requires the load side to meet the flexibility demands at multiple time scales. To address these problems, the paper presents a strategy with two-stage clustering to recognize multiple energy load patterns of higher education buildings at different time scales. In this work, the low frequency component (LFC) and high frequency component (HFC) are obtained from daily load curve by wavelet decomposition, which are clustered by two-stage clustering to construct typical patterns of load at different time scales. Based on these patterns, a series of exploratory studies on their characteristics are launched. The influence characteristic of factors on multiple energy load patterns are revealed. The results show that different functional buildings have obvious differences in the distribution of their electrical LFC patterns on working days and nonworking days, and the shapes of the dominant patterns of power load and cooling load are more consistent with the change of the ambient temperature throughout the day. In addition, the uncertainty of the load pattern is quantified by entropy, which is used to reflect the order degree of the load pattern change over time for each building. The results indicate that probability of a pattern remaining unchanged is higher than transitioning to other patterns, and the uncertainty of HFC pattern for power load is generally higher than that of LFC. The results obtained from this study could be potentially used to enhance DSM. \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.", "2022"]

While different frameworks have been proposed for demand flexibility quantification, the literature still lacks a framework that considers uncertainty sources, affecting building energy control problems, when directly quantifying the demand flexibility potential. We propose a novel framework based on stochastic model predictive control for direct demand flexibility quantification in a bottom-up manner that can account for uncertainty. The proposed framework is utilized to quantify the flexibility potential of a building under uncertainty arising from weather forecasts and the available reduced-order model.

Having a neighboring city adopt a CTG policy was also beneficial as it led to a 7.0 and 3.8% reduction in SO2 and PM2.5 emissions.

Normative feedback has been widely implemented in residential sector for its low cost and high effectivity. However, the potential of energy saving generated from the method has not been fully achieved, as the influence of personality traits and benchmark setting strategy on individual behavioral response has been overlooked. Therefore, this paper incorporates personality traits into the analysis of individual behavior patterns, and proposes a personality-based normative feedback mechanism which optimizes the benchmarks setting strategy in real time by optimal control algorithm. The agent-based modelling method is adopted to develop improved Deffuant-optimal control (DOC) model and to simulate the personality-driven energy conservation of residents under the proposed intervention mechanism. The study finds that intervention effect of the dynamic benchmark setting strategy is superior to normative feedback with fixed benchmarks in terms of energy savings and response agility, and individuals with different personality traits are significantly different in behavioral characteristics. Increase in openness promotes the residents to save energy quickly, and agreeableness has an inverted U-shaped relationship with residents' response agility. Open-minded and agreeable individuals perform well in energy saving while showing stronger boomerang effect. In addition, residents are classified according to their behavioral response patterns and personality traits, in order to analyze the time-dependent response characteristics and boomerang effect of different groups of individuals. The DOC model is evaluated by energy conservation experiments conducted in residential communities of Hangzhou, China.

However, Electrified heating profiles that alter with control decisions can only be obtained from dedicated building modelling that energy system modellers do not usually have the expertise to perform, yet these are required for meaningful studies. This work outlines a novel method for modelling air source and ground source heat pump power demand profiles using a multi-zone physics based building modelling framework with building fabric, thermohydraulic, and air flow subsystems. The novel setup framework allows detailed building layout, fabric and control properties to be assigned by analysts with no prior building modelling expertise.

The model was then validated against real life test house data, under various control and weather conditions. A small relative error (typically within 10%) was observed between modelled and actual cycle lengths, and modelled and actual heat and electricity demands.

One potential approach to address these issues is demand side management, which is increasingly seen as a promising solution to improve grid stability. This is achieved by exploiting demand flexibility and shifting peak demand towards periods of peak renewable energy generation. However, the energy flexibility of a single building needs to be coordinated with other buildings to be used in a flexibility market.

Unlike the current grid, the bidirectional communication enables the information and energy transfer between the entities. Therefore, the complex dilemma, between selling energy and consuming it, outcomes specifically from the prosumer side. This paper proposes a hierarchical solution based on game theory to identify the optimal local consumption and surplus selling of energy while maintaining an agreement between the sellers, the buyers, and the grid. Our method is composed of three mechanisms: (1) the interactions between the sellers and the grid to define the optimal energy consumption, (2) the interactions between the sellers and the buyers to identify the price that maximizes the prosumers gain, (3) the interactions between the grid and the buyers to afford the rest of the needed energy when the second step is not sufficient. The proposed method based on Stackelberg game, takes into consideration the variety of the prosumers present in the energy market system. Depending on the priority accorded to each one and the spatial constraints, an optimal energy demand is defined using Lagrange multipliers. A distributed algorithm is then proposed to manage the complex interactions while preserving the minimum exchange of information, guarantying the privacy of the participants.

One of the major challenges is the optimization of the demand threshold that controls the charging and discharging powers of BESS. To increase its tolerance to day-ahead prediction errors, state-of-art controllers utilize rigid parameters that are determined from long-term historical data. However, long-term historical data may be unavailable at implementation, and rigid parameters cause them unable to adapt to evolving load patterns.

If low-carbon electricity is used, EBM has the potential to be more sustainable than conventional fossil-fuel based vehicles. While BEV feature the highest tank-to-wheel efficiency, electricity can only be stored for short durations in the energy system (e.g. via pumped-hydro storage or batteries), whereas H2-FCEV and SNG-V have a lower tank-to-wheel efficiency due to additional conversion losses, H2 and SNG can be stored longer in pressurized tanks or the natural gas grid. Thus, they feature more flexibility with regard to exploiting renewable electricity via seasonal storage.

Since the trend of load consumption is not uniform with a low load factor in a rural area, the required rating of the system becomes very high. Similarly, the generation is fixed for these MGs, whereas the load increases continuously over time. Such a system faces supply deficit issues triggering a high number of interruptions that may cause frequent blackouts. Hence, rolling blackout and load clipping techniques are preferred during the peak load period in most of the rural MGs. These issues lead to an unreliable power supply and low satisfaction level of the user. This paper presents the load prioritization technique to guarantee the continuous supply for the essential loads within the rural community.

This technique maximized the hours of energy served to the load with higher priority followed by the load with lower priorities.

Traditional solid biomass constitutes most of the households' energy needs, and cooking is by far their most important energy-consuming activity. This paper analyzes household energy use patterns in Nepal through the year 2051 based on a bottom-up simulation accounting framework for seven provinces and the capital city, differentiated by rural and urban areas and seven end-uses. Six scenarios involving different growth paths for socio-economic and energy system development are considered. Unlike in developed economies, the study finds that country's household energy demand will continue to rise in the future, but it is heterogeneous across the provinces. With the government's recent SDG7 initiatives, electricity is expected to play a key role in the household's future energy mix, although biomass use will remain significant but in declining trends. The study also identifies priority provinces where additional action is needed to improve access to clean and affordable modern energy services. Assertive policy initiatives are needed beyond 2030 to pursue clean energy market establishments and end-use technological developments for the expected growth of household clean energy demand. \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd", "2022"]

Recently, utilities have been challenged to consider the implications of low-carbon transitions and the wider benefits of IBDR. What's more, to fully activate demand-side resources, the IBDR scheme's design requires broadening the analysis beyond the traditional disciplines of economic entities and incorporating new psychological cues of customers. In this regard, this paper studies system operator (SO)'s carbon emissions abatement and incentive strategies in peaking shedding events when facing pressure from both emissions tax and customer non-economic response. We develop a trilayer economic-environmental-behavioral IBDR model for incentive price setting and investigate how carbon tax and customer psychological factors (CPFs) affect the scheme design. Initially, the interaction among hierarchical market participators is captured by a trilayer Stackelberg game. Then the SO's problem is formulated as multi-objective to minimize the procurement cost and emission. Moreover, CPFs are incorporated into the model by parameterized assumptions following behavioral economics. Results show that without consideration of CPFs will result in deviation in the DR model. With reasonable carbon prices, IBDR can be an effective tool for both energy efficiency improvement and decarbonization. \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd", "2022"]

One strategy to propagate greenhouse gas emission reductions from the power sector to other sectors is sector coupling. Against this backdrop, we ask the following two questions: (1) To what extent does demand for(useful and final) energy match the supply of renewable energy sources in the dimensions of time and space? (2) What impacts of sector coupling pathways on future infrastructure requirements can be derived from applying spatio-temporal analyses? For our analyses, we assume a scenario with 95% greenhouse gas emission reductions for Germany as a case study targeted by the government for 2050. We choose a consumer-driven approach, analyzing the energy value chain backward from consumption to supply for the different sector coupling technologies. From useful energy consumption, we derive final energy demand patterns in high temporal, sectoral, and regional resolution.

It proposes a methodology for ranking transmission network loads eligible for DSM programs based on the network topology and the size of DSM assets. The influence of network topology is accounted for by considering distribution factors (DFs), and the size of DSM assets by considering the available demand flexibility (upward or downward variation) of load buses. The industrial end-users connected directly to transmission network and the bulk supply points of distribution networks are considered the two main types of DSM providers at the transmission level. The proposed approach facilitates analytical evaluation of the effects of DSM on power transfers and such makes a valuable decision-support tool for any transmission system operator, whether it is used for network operation or planning.

The implementation of an effective energy transition plan faces multiple challenges, spanning from the integration of the operations of different energy carriers and sectors to the consideration of multiple spatial and temporal resolutions. In this review, we outline these challenges and discuss how they have been tackled by the current literature, as well as pointing at directions for future research. Many of the existing reviews identify a list of challenges common to most models, but they tend to be grouped according to type or energy carrier. Here we take a new approach and structure both well-established models and solution approaches along with the main challenges that energy modelling will have to deal with in the near future. We focus on four main current challenges that energy system models face: time and space; uncertainty; multi-energy; energy behaviour and energy transition. The main findings suggest that: demand-side management applied to multi-carrier energy system models lacks; prosumers is explored only in a limited manner; general, multi-scale modelling frameworks should be established and considered both in the dimensions of time, space, technology and energy carrier; long term energy system models tend to address uncertainty scarcely; there is a lack of studies modelling uncertainties related to emerging technologies and; modelling of energy consumer behaviour is one of the major aspect of future research. \u00a9 2022 The Authors", "2022"]

Nowadays, there are several management strategies for DR such as the price-based transactive control strategies. However, many of such existing price-based control strategies neglect the physics and operational constraints of the underlying distribution networks when computing the price, raising concerns regarding their theoretical and practical values. This paper studies this issue and investigates optimal DR (ODR) by incorporating the distribution locational marginal price (DLMP). In particular, we discuss DR in connection with DLMPs and propose a multi-period bilevel optimization problem to find the ODR strategy. The objective is to minimize the peak load, load fluctuation, and payments of load aggregators. In addition, a robust bilevel ODR model is formulated to provide a robust ODR strategy while minimizing operating costs under the worst-case realization of uncertainties; this mitigates the impact of forecasting errors on renewable energy resources. Then, we propose an efficient solution approach by employing the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions and strong duality.

This transition is felt throughout the entire economy and is affecting the long and short term operations of the energy system. In the last decade, the research community has made significant efforts to model the energy transition and its impacts. Typically, these models focus on a limited subset of the different components of the energy-economic system, including investments in centralized and distributed generation, electricity markets, electric power grids, security of supply, and macro-economic effects. However, there are research questions that require the analysis of how these different aspects are connected to each other and how they may interact. Therefore, the research community has stressed the need to leverage models across domains to enhance the capabilities and robustness of their results. Due partly to the high complexity of combining models developed in tangential domains, few attempts have been made to model in full the interactions among the interdependent components of the energy-economic system. The Nexus-e: interconnected energy systems modeling platform aims to show how this gap can be filled by demonstrating that an interdisciplinary set of models can be integrated in a model framework by linking them through structured interfaces. This platform combines four bottom-up models that capture different aspects of the electricity system and one top-down macro-economic model to represent a much broader scope of the energy-economic system as compared to traditional stand-alone modeling approaches. In this paper, we study the benefits and limitations of the interfaces established among the modules in Nexus-e with reference to the Swiss electricity system in a European context. We demonstrate that prominent changes in operational behavior could drive investments and should therefore be assessed in a framework that considers both transmission and distribution systems in a coordinated manner. We show that the bottom-up investments and operations (transmission and distribution) can have an impact on the overall economy, which in response can affect the demand for electricity. Moreover, we demonstrate that the changes in generation mix and operation behaviors may have a significant impact on system security. For policymakers, the approach can provide spatially detailed power system transformation options that enable decisions that are socially, politically, and technically acceptable. \u00a9 2021 The Author(s)", "2022"]

The valve point loading problem of distributed generators and its effect on input-output characteristics is not extensively covered in the published scientific literature on microgrids. In this research work, the day-ahead scheduling problem of microgrids is formulated in the presence of DGs with a nonconvex cost function. First, the flexible load-shaping based demand-side management strategy is adopted to reduce the peak loads and enhance the DG's unit operational costs. The impact of demand-side management and price-driven demand response programs on convex and nonconvex energy management system (EMS) problems is investigated. Furthermore, the short-term scheduling horizon of 15-minutes resolution time is considered for both solar and wind power to maintain forecast accuracy. The state-of-art optimization algorithm of quantum particle swarm optimization is devised to solve the proposed problem in the presence of the nonconvex cost function of DGs. The technical performance indices for each demand response program is evaluated, and the best alternative demand response program is chosen by implementing analytical hierarchy process. The proposed algorithm efficiently solves the nonconvex EMS problem, and the simulation results yield a 12.11% reduction in operating cost without compromising customer satisfaction.

The exploitation of the energy flexibility reserve obtainable from buildings cooling-loads management can have an important role to improve the security and the reliability of the electricity power grid. Many studies in literature assess the energy flexibility potential of air conditioning systems; however, the role of the specific cooling technology is always scarcely explored. The objective of this work is to provide an evaluation of the operational energy flexibility that can be obtained involving the most common residential space cooling technologies, paying particular attention to the distribution system (e.g., all-air system, fan-coil units with and without the addition of a thermal energy storage and hydronic massive systems). The analysis is carried out with dynamic simulation models for the various cooling systems involved. Results show a great influence of the adopted distribution system in the implementation of a flexibility request. In particular, all-air systems (i.e. split systems) show the lower flexible behavior (they require up to 10 h of precooling to be off during a peak hour). Whereas the adoption of fan coil units coupled with a thermal energy storage allows to implement different peak shaving strategies without compromising the indoor air temperature with low drawback effects in terms of anticipated electricity overconsumptions (no precooling of the air is required and a maximum of 23 % increase in electricity consumed in the time before the event occurs, with a reduction of 16 % in subsequent hours). In case of ceiling cooling systems, results highlight that as the thermal inertia of the system increases, the indoor conditions are less affected, but the anticipated overconsumption of the heat pump increases (for the same Demand Response event the electricity overconsumption goes from + 67 % to +116 %, passing from ceiling panels to concrete ceiling). The results obtained from this analysis are then used to draw flexibility curves, which aim at providing a characterization of the flexibility of a cooling system. They can be used to predict, for typical installations, the system behavior in presence of a peak power reduction strategy in terms of pre-cooling duration, energy use variation and modification of the temperature comfort bandwidth. Such predictions are important because they can provide insights on the design and operation of space cooling systems in demand side management strategies. \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.", "2021"]

A relevant finding is the existing potential points of frictions between options aimed to reduce energy demand and those acting on its temporality.

Extending the approach of Wozabal et al.

While the minimum price variance for most countries is found to be between a 10% and 40% renewable electricity production share, price variance is higher for lower and higher shares. The availability of export and import capacities, flexible power plants, and hydro (pump) storage is more important for a country's ability to balance price variance than the level and variance of the renewable infeed itself. Several countries (e.g., Denmark) show how these factors can foster successful integration of high shares of renewables. The finding that the price variance decreases before it rises again in many European countries calls for policies to secure investments in flexibility options, such as grid expansion, storage facilities, flexible power plants, and demand-side management, in the period of low price variance when market-based solutions might fail and eventually lead to situations where electricity system stability is at risk. \u00a9 2021", "2022"]

The role of policies that support energy efficiency measures and demand-side management practices will be critical and to ensure that energy demand models are relevant to policymakers and other end-users, understanding how to further improve the models and whether they are tailored to user needs to support efficient decision-making processes is crucial. So far though, no scientific studies have examined the key user needs for energy demand modelling in the context of the climate neutrality targets. In this article we address this gap using a multi-method approach based on empirical and desk research. Through survey and stakeholder meetings and workshops we identify user needs of different stakeholder groups, and we highlight the direction in which energy demand models need to be improved to be relevant to their users. Through a detailed review of existing energy demand models, we provide a full understanding of the key characteristics and capabilities of existing tools, and we identify their limitations and gaps. Our findings show that classical demand-related questions remain important to model users, while most of the existing models can answer these questions. Furthermore, we show that some of the user needs related to sectoral demand modelling, dictated by the latest policy developments, are under-researched and are not addressed by existing tools. \u00a9 2022 The Authors", "2022"]

Compared to gas fired water heaters, electric water heaters (EWH) can be powered by renewable generation resources, thus making it a potential renewable heating option. Furthermore, with the growing need for energy storage, incorporation of renewable resources, and initiatives worldwide, the electrification of DHW heating is expected to continue the rapid growth. However, many commercial EWH products with monitoring and alerting functionalities lack the intelligence to optimize and perform predictive control with data; on the other hand, research studies with refined models and simulations come short in incorporating real-time data and providing robust optimal controls under uncertainties in real-world settings. This paper presents a EWH Smart Scheduling and Control System using data-driven disturbance forecasts in a robust Model Predictive Control (MPC) to accomplish various demand side management objectives. Testing with a real-world EWH dataset and a two-state EWH model, robust MPC simulations are conducted on a central EWH supplying DHW for a multi-unit apartment building with quantified prediction uncertainty. Results show that the proposed system is capable of anticipating DHW demand with an uncertainty interval covering up to 97% of the actual demand during the test days and reducing electricity cost up to 33.2% as well as maintaining a desired DHW temperature without affecting user comfort. Further, the flexibility of the system to alter load profiles under different Demand Response (DR) programs is demonstrated. Reductions in both power and water consumption can be accomplished. The proposed system can create an implementable solution of forecasting DHW usage and optimizing controls as a part of a robust and reliable building energy management and control system in real-world settings. \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.", "2021"]

In this set-up, an aggregator acts as the leader, setting energy prices for each node, and price-responsive consumers are the followers, adjusting their demand according to the price charged. We show that this problem has an equilibrium in which the optimal demands can be written as a function of the Lagrange multipliers of the problem. For each node, voltage and current shadow costs have a cumulative effect that depends both on the upstream path to the substation and on the downstream demand level. We compare the Stackelberg solution to a centralized approach which maximizes social welfare. Our analysis reveals that, although the system-level optimal demand is higher in the centralized case, some individual nodes have higher consumption in the Stackelberg game. This counter-intuitive result cannot be observed in network-free formulations commonly adopted in game-theoretic works on demand-side management, where a centralized approach benefits every individual consumer.

This paper proposes a game theory\u2013based hierarchical demand optimization method for energy flexible buildings for achieving better grid interactions. This method consists of two optimization strategies at the grid and building levels. At the grid level, a demand-price interaction model for buildings and the grid is established to identify the Nash equilibrium solutions based on game theory; these solutions are used to determine the optimized energy demand of buildings and the associated electricity prices by accommodating the interests of all participants involved. At the building level, three types of buildings with different energy flexibilities are investigated to analyze the influence of building management strategies on grid interactions.

The research object of this study is a two-story detached residence integrated with HEMS in the \u201cJono Zero Carbon Smart Community\u201d in Japan.

Then a dynamic pricing model was developed to guide the users\u2019 electricity consumption behavior and adjust the grid load. According to the prediction results obtained by the load forecasting model, the annual electricity charges of users under the three pricing schemes of multistep electricity pricing (MEP), time-of-use pricing (TOU), and real-time pricing (RTP) were calculated and compared. The result indicated that the annual electricity cost generated by RTP was less than those generated by MTP and TOU. In addition, after adjusting the users\u2019 peak load and combining it with the fluctuating future electricity prices, RTP presented evident economic advantage over MTP and TOU in terms of the annual electricity cost of the users.

The reduction of the peak demand and energy saving are the two key attributes furnished by implementing the CVR strategy. The voltage source inverter (VSI) based AC microgrid enables the integration of renewable energy sources (RES) to the AC network. Apart from facilitating the process of power generation, the VSI enabled renewable energy sources conducts the ancillary service such as demand side management (DSM) with the enforcement of CVR.

A new approach is devised to compute the droop parameter for V-I droop which performs CVR action to realize demand side management.

With demand-side management, consumption profiles can be adapted to generation profiles which can be posed as an optimization problem.

A computational experiment is set up in order to test increasing numbers of agents. Results show that the centralized approach, although finding the optimal solution, shows running times that are two orders of magnitude greater than the decentralized method, which is able to find high quality solutions at lower time cost but with increased monetary cost.

In Pakistan, the power sector faces the challenge of exceptionally increasing electricity demand in metropolitan areas and the urgency of reliable power access in rural areas. In this paper, a regional power-generation system of GB is developed using the LEAP (Long-range Energy Alternative Planning) model from 2016 to 2050, to explore future clean pathways to understand the planning and operational implications of futuristic variable renewables (VRE) and best available technologies (BAT). The regional power system model is further expanded by using the end-user and econometric approaches to construct five scenarios which include Business-As-Usual (BAU), BAU-OPT (BAU-optimization), Demand Side Management (DSM), DSM-OPT, and National Energy Mix (NEM). The model estimates the electricity demand projection of 3.2 TWh in 2050, at an annual average growth rate of 3.19%, and suggests that hydropower is the most dominant variable renewable source in GB's electric power system. The adoption of the BAT would avoid 1.34 TWh or about 41% of the projected electricity consumption, which shows the maximum potential of energy efficiency measures in GB. Moreover, the results indicate that: i) home appliances and lighting account for nearly halved of the reduction potential; while lighting and cooking are the most cost effective measures in terms of energy saving at regional level; ii) least cost constraint displays the transition towards large scale renewable projects; iii) the penetration of small scale renewable project is nearly doubled under least cost constraint by the introduction of demand side measures; and iv) higher emission penalties aggressively shift energy mix toward renewables with the cost of annual environmental externalities reducing in long-term.

Secondly, the SMG voltage and frequency are optimally regulated using an improved PID-based mixed sensitivity H-infinity (PID-MSH\u221e) control scheme while operating in islanded mode.

The specific fuel consumption (SFC) of each diesel engine changes nonlinearly with respect to its power product. Hence, this paper presents an economic fuel dispatch model for diesel engines powered oil rig platforms using the cubic spline interpolation curve fitting of the SFC-power non-linear dependence. Moreover, the total fuel consumption of the diesel generators significantly reduces by shifting a partial part of the electricity demand of the offshore drilling rigs from on-peak time intervals to off-peak periods. In addition, battery energy storage contributes to the load curve smoothing strategy. A mixed-integer non-linear programming problem is developed under generalized algebraic mathematical modeling system to find the optimum fuel consumption and power generation schedules of the diesel producers, the value of demand increase/decrease, and the charge/discharge pattern of the battery at each operating time interval. A benchmark oil rig with eight diesel engines and four tidal turbines is considered to validate the proposed methodology.

Guided by the literature from the Global North and West Africa, an integrative review of literature and a content analysis of 52 sampled studies based on a literature search strategy was undertaken.

The optimal solution at 50% RES share includes a maximum of 11 GWh of battery and 29.8 GWh of hydrogen storage capacity.

For example, DSM is a kind of load redistribution process in which the energy payback constraints associated with comfort or usage demand should be considered. Therefore, this work studies the optimal energy management of a building energy system (BES) considering multi-energy flexibility measures, specifically under the energy payback effect, to better guide the peak shaving strategies. First, energy substitution measures are proposed involving energy conversion and storage modeling. Second, a novel dynamic two-step DSM measure is modeled for the reduction and recovery process. Then, a mixed-integer and linear programming (MILP)-based energy management model is developed to optimize the operation of smart buildings for peak shaving. The case studies demonstrate that 1) a BES can obtain better profit by utilizing multi-energy flexibility measures; 2) optimized multi-load recovery strategies can enhance the flexibility potential of a BES; and 3) a reasonable multi-load recovery mechanism should be established to offset the energy payback effect. \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.", "2021"]

Through the in-depth demand analysis including quantification of energy consumption dynamics and consumer preferences, energy decision-makers can develop reasonable and forethoughtful energy efficiency plans and demand-response programs. Previous work in energy-demand behavioral research relied primarily on ideal socio-economic models or data-driven approaches, both of which lack flexibility, intuition and interpretability. This paper proposes a novel spatio-temporal visual analysis approach for urban energy consumption pattern discovery in order to identify energy-saving potentials, plan energy supply and improve energy efficiency. In this approach, energy consumption time series are embeded into a two-dimensional scatterplot for coordinated visual exploration. Users can interactively explore and discover different patterns for decision-making purposes. In addition, we propose the method for modeling energy demand shift patterns based on a potential flow method and integrate it into a pattern exploration tool. The proposed approach is comprehensively evaluated through empirical studies using the real-world electricity consumption data from Pudong district, Shanghai. We identify five typical energy consumption patterns and demand shift patterns across different geographical locations, which can be well interpreted by the knowledge of energy consumption in the area of interest. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and the tool. This tool can be integrated into smart energy systems for a better understanding of user energy consumption behaviors and preferences. \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd", "2021"]

Aggregators and Energy Service COmpanies (ESCOs) can perform this support role, but only provided that their goals are aligned to those of the community, not to incur in the agency problem. In this study, we propose a business model for aggregators of ECs, and its optimization problem, accounting for all crucial aspects: (i) alleviating the risk of the agency problem, (ii) fairly distributing the reward awarded to the EC, (iii) estimating the fair payment for the aggregator services, and (iv) defining appropriate exit clauses ruling what happens when a user leaves the EC. A mathematical model is developed, employing several fair game-theoretic reward distribution schemes, some of which are proposed here for the first time. A case study is developed, and results show that the aggregator enables reducing costs by 16% and improving renewable penetration and self/shared consumption by 35%\u201351% with respect to the base case.

Price and income elasticity are two fundamental parameters to guide both scholars and policy-makers in assessing whether and to what extend Chinese households respond to the policy.

The fast growth of embedded generation with other advanced power electronic interfaces and components along with energy storage devices change the operating pattern of the integrated power system scenario.

The main determinants of its electricity draw are physical properties such as set temperature, insulation, and plumbing configuration; environmental conditions such as ambient temperature and inlet temperature; and the hot water usage profiles.

We gathered data from 77 residential households over a period of one year to train and evaluate the model for all four seasons.

The full economic potential of price arbitrage with nodal storage hinges not only on battery characteristics (energy-to-power ratio) but crucially also on the quality of price forecasting. Economic theory can also quantify the intrinsic profitability limitations as increased storage deployment smoothes price variations. The profitability of supply-side storage for intermittent power producers depends on the exposure to curtailment risk and thus the empirical distribution of negative price episodes. Demand-side storage can be economical when improved utilization of existing power lines avoids expanding them, and this trade-off potential is captured in a theoretical model.

However, the existing literature investigating abatement from COVID-19 mainly overlooked the overwhelming emissions reduction in Europe's power sector. We address this by assessing the intricate relationship between electricity demand shocks and heterogeneous generation technologies in the power sectors of 16 major European economies during January to March 2020. We apply an econometric model in an instrumental-variables framework. In a first step, we assess the impact of COVID-19 infections on electricity demand, and in a second step how this translates into emissions abatement. We find that, during full lockdown, COVID-19 reduced electricity demand by 19% and carbon emissions by an astonishing 34% per hour, whereas there is severe country heterogeneity depending on the electricity supply structure and demand shock intensity.

While time-of-use (TOU) programs could help moderate this demand, in many countries such programs are voluntary, with low enrollment rates.

Two of the framings emphasized the economic benefits of the program, and offered 25% and 50% off-peak discount rates. The other two framings highlighted environmental benefits and national energy independence (in addition to the discount). The impact of socio-demographic variables, demand flexibility, convenience, environmental awareness and interest in automation were also evaluated.

This may boost the development of peer-to-peer (P2P) market mechanisms. Meanwhile, since actual load and power generation may substantially deviate from schedules obtained at the day-ahead (forward) market stage, it is needed to rapidly reschedule the trades among agents to maintain power balance through a real-time market mechanism, also in a P2P framework. However, it is technically challenging to develop and operate such P2P market mechanisms in real-time, since they most often involve a heavy computational burden (e.g., based on iterative distributed optimization approaches), while real-time trading demands fast calculation. Our core contribution is hence to describe and analyze a novel online optimization framework to enable the real-time P2P market. It relies on online social welfare maximization using a novel online consensus alternating direction method of multipliers (OC-ADMM) algorithm. The computational complexity is then heavily reduced since only one iteration is performed for each agent at every time step in order to satisfy real-time requirements.

To this effect, the potential cost and benefit of biogas digesters were explored. The biogas digesters were characterised under controlled conditions before being deployed to the KrwaKrwa and Upper Ncera villages in the Eastern Cape, South Africa. At the control site, meteorological weather parameters that influence biogas production were monitored continuously. Based on typical rural household electrical usage profile from 2-years of data observed at the sub-station level, assumptions about the cooking times and electrical demands were made. It was found that the bio-digesters are capable of supplying the energy required for cooking, provided the digesters are continuously fed at least every 5th day. Also, 1.0 m3 of CH4 is equivalent to 4.70 kWh of electricity. With reloading after every 5th day, the total biogas produced per day over 31 days is 2.93 m3. This is equivalent to demand-side avoidance of 13.77 kWh/day and monetary savings of R26,88/day or R833,43/month. A financial cost of approximately R 17 000,00 per digester, Net Present Value of R22 000,00 and a payback period of 22 months was obtained for the feasibility of the project. Based on the findings of the study, it can be said that biogas digesters are financially sound investments and economically feasible at both household and societal levels. These digesters can also ensure that the household remains above the poverty threshold. \u00a9 2021 The Author(s)", "2021"]

This results from the combination of the supply chain losses, the rebound effect of demand increases, following efficiency improvements, and the vigorous economic development in South-East Asia. Even under the COVID-19 crisis, China has come again on the path of economic growth. The efficiency improvements in energy generation, supply, use, and waste heat recovery are needed drivers to reduce energy consumption and emissions. This contribution is examining the recent technology developments and research of the key elements in the design and operation of sustainable energy processes, systems, and networks. The interactions among the stages of energy conversion, distribution, storage and final use are meticulously investigated, and the critical features that are associated with breakthrough performance in terms of sustainability have been identified. Identification of highly efficient and sustainable energy materials through a systematic approach, whether serving energy conversion mechanisms, mitigation of harmful emissions and by-products, energy storage is of paramount importance for the design of sustainable energy systems. Advanced design methods focusing on multi-scale modelling covering the aspects from the molecular level to the process level and ultimately to the plant and network-level have been discussed, and the main challenges have been pinpointed. Heat exchange units, as the backbone of any energy integration system, pose a great challenge in achieving highly-performing energy systems. Advanced operation strategies supported by sophisticated optimal decision tools and control schemes enable the efficient operation and the maintenance of sustainability under uncertain and perpetually varying conditions.

Although a large number of energy prediction methods have been proposed, each method has its pros and cons and still exhibits the potential to be improved.

The prediction performance of the proposed hybrid model measured via root-mean-square-error and mean absolute error are 4.02 and 2.87 respectively, which are evidently better than those of the base models. Results also show that an attention mechanism can improve the efficiency of the long short-term memory algorithm with which the model uses the input time series data. Meanwhile, binary features exert a significant effect on energy consumption. The proposed model is valuable to researchers and practitioners.

However, tremendous difficulties are introduced in designing a reasonable pricing mechanism to impart the enthusiasm for participating in the DR scheme. In this paper, an optimal operation model with high authenticity is established which is tractable after the model transformation, linearization, and relaxation techniques. Firstly, a bilevel optimal operation model considering the part load rate (PLR) characteristics of units and DR scheme under real-time pricing is developed. Secondly, Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions are utilized to transform this bilevel optimization problem into a single-level optimization. Thirdly, the piecewise linearization technique is described to cope with the non-linear PLR characteristics of the units.

The MG energy management systems\u2019 problem will become tedious by considering distributed generation (DG) units' nonconvex characteristics. Therefore, a novel attempt is made to solve the day-ahead dispatch problem of grid-connected MG with the nonconvex cost function of DG units, including weekend and weekday load dynamics. At first, the utility-induced flexible load shaping strategy is implemented to enhance the DG units' operation cost and reduce the peak loads. Then, demand-side management (DSM) programs are plausibly the essential form of energy management to regulate the consumers' energy usage without violating grid price policies. Next, the DSM program is implemented to study the impact of DSM participation levels with convex and nonconvex cost functions. Further, the day-ahead scheduling time duration with a resolution of 15 minutes is considered to examine the impact of a typical weekend and weekday load dynamics on DG units' nonconvex cost function. Finally, the Quantum Teaching-Learning-Based Optimization algorithm (QTLA) is devised to handle the nonconvex cost function of DG units and optimize MG's total operating costs for the first time. The proposed QTLA algorithm is compared with other metaheuristic optimization techniques such as differential evolution (DE), real-coded genetic algorithm (RCGA), and Teaching-Learning-based Optimization (TLBO). The results show that the proposed strategy reduces the MG operating cost by 3.14% compared to the case study, where no DSM participation is considered.

In today's power system, these conditions are mostly reasoned through the uncertain performance of a number of parameters e.g. price, so the use of uncertainty modeling becomes necessary. In the present work, an optimization model, based on virus search colony, is used for the optimal performance of intelligent parking of electric vehicles in uncertainty situations caused by the price of the upstream grid in the demand response (DRP) program. It has been used to reduce the daily cost of performance by changing various parts of the load between peak and off-peak intervals. Virus Colony Search (VCS) method is a method based on the random-based population, which is also based on specific behaviors of the virus. Chaos theory has been used to develop this algorithm and improve local and global search. Moreover, the proposed multi-objective algorithm is a model based on non-dominated sorting model, variable detection, memory-based strategy selection and fuzzy theory to select the best Pareto from the answer set. Besides, it has a powerful function in solving the above problem. Regarding the mentioned techniques, the possibility of being in local points is reduced and the speed of convergence to the final response is increased.

The energy management scheme of DC microgrid (MG) is mainly controlled by main energy resource of MG. Main energy resource needs to be dispatchable unit for forming the reference voltage within DC MG. In this work, a micro hydro generator (MHG) is considered as a dispatchable source for forming the sustainable voltage level of DC MG operating under the abnormal condition. In this work, the abnormality refers to the outage of solar PV due to intermittency during fluctuating load condition. But, due to mechanical time constant of MHG and rate of charging/discharging current limit of energy storage system, the fluctuating load cannot get compensated. The uncompensated fluctuating load results in unsustainable voltage control of DC MG. The CEMS proposed in this work, maintains sustainable voltage level of DC MG during the load power fluctuation through a coordination of mechanical control loop (MCL)-electrical control loop (ECL). The coordination targets sustainable voltage control of MG with optimal power extraction of micro hydro generation. To ensure the optimal power from MHG during load power fluctuation, CEMS operates it in the variable speed mode through pre-set load controller (PSLC) and proportional predictive controller. Depending on the type of load power fluctuation, the proportional predictive controller generates a reference torque to MCL based on the predicted speed change set by PSLC. PSLC predicts the load power and speed change on iteration basis. MCL sets proportional mechanical power to the permanent magnet synchronous generator through hydro turbine. Then, MHG is going to dispatch the proportional DC power to the load through voltage-oriented control scheme of active rectifier. ECL balances the mismatched power flow between the output power of MHG and fluctuating load through a battery-SC based energy storage system.

Using case studies with different information transmission error rates and other conditions, the proposed strategy is demonstrated to be an effective solution for the large-scale distributed demand response implementation, with a robust response capability under even remarkable transmission errors. By integrating the proposed strategy, the requirement for the large-scale distributed systems, especially the information systems, is highly eased, leading to the acceleration of the practical demand response implementation. \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2021 Liu, Gao, Sun, Yang, Zhang, Gao and Huang.", "2021"]

In this article, a bilevel programming model is proposed based on the demand response to coordinate the master-slave hierarchical relationship in the electricity market. At the upper level, the main grid determines the prices and generation for the supplier's maximum profit. At the lower level, we consider multiple microgrids, which operate in isolated-island or grid-connected mode, with photovoltaic generation system, energy storage system, and loads. Then, the optimal energy strategy is emerged for the user's maximum welfare according to the dynamic prices. Furthermore, we solve the upper and lower models separately to avoid user privacy being violated. The upper problem uses the genetic algorithm (GA), while the lower problem is handled by the branch and bound algorithm (BBA). A novel distributed algorithm named GA-BBA is developed accordingly. Finally, taking an example of a smart grid system with three microgrids, the model and algorithm are simulated and compared. The results show that the peak-to-average ratio under the real-time pricing is reduced from 1.6547 (fixed electricity price) and 1.4513 (time-of-use) to 1.2545. The peak-to-valley difference is also decreased by approximately 14.33%. In addition, the total social welfare of the system is increased by 145.53 kCNY (Chinese Yuan) through comparison with the existing model. The conclusions verify that the proposed bilevel programming model not only effectively reduces peak load but also increases the social welfare, which is more reasonable and realistic. Novelty Statement: A novel bilevel optimization energy management system is proposed to optimize the hierarchical market structure between the main grid and multi-microgrids (MMGs). A RTP mechanism based on demand response is formulated to balance the benefits between the main grid and MMGs. Moreover, the optimal energy strategy is obtained along with the dynamic price. Besides the operating cost, users' utility in microgrids are taken to our model. A hybrid distributed GA-BBA is developed to protect the user's utility privacy. \u00a9 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd", "2021"]

Demand response strategies can reduce the time-of-use costs and overall electrical energy consumption. We present a method to reduce the electrical energy usage itself. Our novel heating schedule control minimises the electric water heater's energy usage without compromising user convenience. We achieve optimal control, while taking into account the natural temperature stratification of the water in the tank, using the A* search algorithm. Since previous research assumes a one-node thermal model, we also assess the effect of excluding stratification. We match three optimal control strategies to a baseline: the standard \u201calways on\u201d thermostat control. The first two strategies respectively match the temperature and the energy of the hot water supplied by the water heater. The third, a variation on the second, includes a method of preventing the growth of Legionella bacteria. We tested 77 water heaters over four weeks, a week for each season, and all three strategies saved energy. The median savings were 6.3% for temperature-matching, 21.9% for energy-matching and 16.2% for energy-matching with Legionella prevention. Taking stratification into account increased these savings by 1.2%, 5.4% and 5.5% respectively. \u00a9 2021 International Energy Initiative", "2021"]

Although there is an increasing number of case studies about the TES applications, crosswise techno-economic evaluations of different technologies are rare, especially for applications in individual heating systems where the storage temperature range is less than 20 K. Hence, in this study, three TES options; water tank (WT), phase change material tank, and building thermal mass (BTM) are simulated and compared. A systematic analysis approach was proposed to assure impartial comparisons of the energy performance and the life-cycle costs (LCC). Special focus was paid on practical issues such as restricted charging power for different TES technologies. It was found that the majority of LCC savings arises from the peak load reduction. The study also shows that BTM is the most cost-effective TES technology while the WT is the least attractive option, due to larger heat loss and lower storage density. Moreover, less discharged energy and cost savings were found in well-insulated buildings due to the restricted discharging power. Still, there could be more incentives for household TES technologies if additional prices or policies are implemented. \u00a9 2021 The Author(s)", "2021"]

This has important impacts on future water management and energy system planning decisions. In this study, we quantify the physical water use of power production and virtual water transfer via power transmission between Chinese provinces using the information on 5408 electricity-generating units and interprovincial power transmission. We show that China's power production withdrew 62.7 billion m3 of freshwater in 2017, of which 13 billion m3 was consumed (i.e. not returned to the original water basin but lost via evaporation, etc.). A large volume of freshwater was virtually traded through the transmission system. Overall, 6.2 billion m3 of freshwater withdrawal and 2.1 billion m3 of water consumption was traded. Nationally, power transmission reduced freshwater withdrawal but increased consumption in China because, compared to the east, the west generally has a larger water consumption factor but a lower withdrawal factor. Water stress was more equally distributed across provinces through power transmission. We find large seasonal variations in inter-regional virtual water consumption transfer, with an August peak. While the Yangtze River basin and downstream of the Yellow River basin have abundant water relative to other basins, the many power plants located along the two rivers aggravate local water stress. These dynamics will become increasingly important for policymakers and energy planners as China undergoes climatic changes and a rapid energy transition. \u00a9 2021 The Authors", "2021"]

From a system-level perspective, such programs reduce costs, enhance reliability, and reduce network issues. Similarly, DSM programs help participating customers reduce utility bills while maintaining occupant comfort. Understanding the relationship between EE and DF is key to realizing the full potential of DSM programs. In this study, we modeled an all-electric residential community based on a 498-home community that is planned for construction in Fort Collins, Colorado in the United States. We used this community model to study the relationship between different EE measures, including building envelope upgrades and smart appliances, and DF enabled by a home energy management system (HEMS) responding to a time-varying tariff. Various EE levels in the homes \u2013 code-minimum, zero energy ready, and even higher levels of envelope efficiency \u2013 were simulated. DF is enabled by the HEMS, which coordinates behind-the-meter resources, including flexible building loads, PV, and home battery systems, to minimize utility bills while maintaining occupant comfort. When comparing to the code-minimum homes, EE upgrades alone reduce HVAC energy use during peak hours by up to 50% and the HVAC utility bill by up to $312/year. With the addition of HEMS, the average daily peak demand can be reduced by up to 0.58 MW or 1.2 kW/home in the higher envelope efficiency homes. The combination of EE upgrades, HEMS, and home battery systems is expected to save homeowners up to $590/year while increasing community load flexibility. However, HEMS and home battery systems are less effective in increasing the DF in the more efficient homes due to the lower load. \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd", "2021"]

While electrification has provided these communities a variety of economic and social opportunities, diesel consumption has resulted in adverse costs and environmental pollution. Two technologies available to reduce the expense and emissions of diesel fuel reliance include dual fuel or hybrid diesel applications. The dual-fuel approach involves a supplementary gas fuel charge in support of reduced diesel fuel consumption. Hybrid applications involve the integration of renewable generation to displace diesel fuel consumption. This paper reviews the potential for hybrid dual-fuel applications, identifying engine flexibility as a major integration barrier. In comparing the flexibility of various dual-fuel technologies to operate dynamically, this paper presents a critical review across hydrogen, liquified petroleum gas (LPG), natural gas (NG) and blended hydrogen and NG derivatives. The results identify a range of approaches able to improve engine flexibility and thus reduce the cost and carbon intensity of diesel-fired internal combustion engines. At low load conditions, while NG and LPG exhibit similar performance, the use of hydrogen and hydrogen blends provide improved engine performance and response. Unfortunately, given the current cost of hydrogen fuel, significant commercial barriers exist to the adoption of hydrogen or hydrogen blended fuels. Despite this, this review indicates the potential of hydrogen-NG blends to offer additional flexibility in comparison to alternative dual-fuel technologies.

Time-of-use tariffs are often applied to implement traditional strategies such as peak shaving and valley filling that are more functional to conventional grids. Time-of-use tariffs are however not suitable to matching customer demands as the periodic charges are fixed and cannot be match with stochastic renewable power generations.

Energy poverty limits their ability to take autonomous actions to improve air circulation and the cooling of their homes. It is therefore important that electricity-access planners explicitly evaluate the current and future air circulation and cooling needs of energy-poor households, in addition to other basic energy needs. To address this issue, we combine climate, socio-economic, demographic and satellite data with scenario analysis to model spatially explicit estimates of potential cooling demand from households that currently lack access to electricity. We link these demand factors into a bottom-up electrification model for sub-Saharan Africa, the region with the world's highest concentration of energy poverty. Accounting for cooling needs on top of baseline household demand implies that the average electrification investment requirements grow robustly (a scenario mean of 65.5% more than when considering baseline household demand only), mostly due to the larger generation capacity needed. Future climate change could increase the investment requirements by an additional scenario mean of 4%. Moreover, the share of decentralised systems as the lowest-cost electrification option falls by a scenario mean 4.5 percentage points of all new connections. The crucial determinants for efficient investment pathways are the adoption and use of cooling appliances, the extent of climate change, and the baseline electricity demand.

Effective load monitoring is an important step to provide efficient demand response (DR) to PAR. In this paper, we focus on pool pump analytics and present a deep learning framework, PUMPNET, to identify the pool pump operation patterns from power consumption data. Different from conventional time-series based Non-intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) methods, our approach transfers the time-series data into image-like (date-time matrix) data. Then a U-shaped fully convolutional neural network is developed to detect and segment the image-like data in pixel level for operation detection. Our approach identify whether pool pumps operate given thirty-minute interval aggregated active power consumption data in kilowatt-hours only. Furthermore, the PUMPNET algorithm could identify pool pump operation status with high accuracy in the low-frequency sampling scenario for thousands of household, compared to traditional NILM algorithms which process high sampling rate data and can only apply to limited number of households. Experiments on real-world data validate the promising results of the proposed PUMPNET model. \u00a9 2021, The Author(s).", "2021"]

Real-time pricing (RTP) is an effective method for DSM, which can flexibly guide the supply and demand sides to adjust their behavior to participate in demand response (DR). In this paper, a hierarchical energy system is studied including multiple RIESs with multiple energy dispatch and supplement. To maximize the social welfare, a bilevel programming model is developed, in which the upper level aims at maximizing the profits of the supplier, and the lower level aims at maximizing the RIESs' welfare. Then, the proposed bilevel model is transformed into a mixed integer quadratic programming model using duality theory and Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions. Furthermore, the RTP strategy is obtained, and the optimal energy scheme of RIES is given in the solution. Compared simulations in different scenarios, the total social welfare is increased by about 14.12%, the peak-to-valley difference of power load and carbon emissions are reduced by 16.99% and 5.7% respectively after DR.

However, due to the great burdens of fully considering each users' characteristics, it is difficult to achieve unity of the individual optimal decisions and global optimum in demand-side management (DSM). This paper proposes a game-theoretic DSM that can optimize the global power consumption schedule by individual TCL user's optimization. By integrating the prediction of REN outputs into the pricing mechanism, the proposed DSM can guide the users to make their best power consumption schedules along with intermittent REN generations, thus to smooth the tie-line power of microgrids. In this paper, a novel pricing mechanism is firstly developed based on the concave N-person game theory, which is more adaptive and flexible compared with existing game-theoretic DSM. Then, an individual's power consumption optimization and its simplified model are developed considering the constraints of the TCL model and personal preferences. The simplified model can be easily solved and achieve a fast solution in the power consumption game. An implementation framework of the proposed DSM is further developed for practical application.

All the entities in the system are foresighted: each aggregator seeks to minimize its own long-term payments for energy purchase and operational costs of energy storage by deciding how much energy to buy from the ISO, and the ISO seeks to minimize the long-term total cost of the system (e.g., energy generation costs and the aggregators' costs) by dispatching the energy production among the generators. The decision making of the foresighted entities is complicated for two reasons. First, the information is decentralized among the entities, namely each entity does not know the others' states. Second, an aggregator's current decision affects its future costs due to the coupling introduced by the energy storage. We propose a design framework in which the ISO provides each aggregator with a conjectured future price, and each aggregator distributively minimizes its own long-term cost based on its conjectured price as well as its locally-available information. We prove that the proposed framework can achieve the social optimum despite being decentralized and involving complex coupling. Simulation results show that the proposed foresighted demand side management achieves significant reduction in the total cost, compared to the optimal myopic demand side management (up to 60% reduction), and the foresighted demand side management based on the Lyapunov optimization framework (up to 30% reduction).  \u00a9 2010-2012 IEEE.", "2021"]

Time-of-use tariffs and other methods of time-dependant pricing can be mutually beneficial, realising a cost reduction for both energy companies and customers if the customer responds to the price signalling. However, such tariffs are likely to create positive and negative financial outcomes for individuals because of customer engagement and potential peak shifting capacity.

Grid interconnections, where available, play a vital role in the energy system as provide the required balance between energy consumption and demand but many limitations emerge due to cable capacity and other technical constraints, which in many cases, lead to curtailment events.

In this advanced era of technology, the requirement of electrical energy is continuously increasing. However, the overall growth of electricity generation is comparatively slower due to depletion of fuel sources. In this situation, a strategic plan needs to be implemented at consumer end to mitigate the energy crisis. As such, the concept of DSM is introduced where consumers can save electricity bills by changing their consumption pattern. It subsequently reduces the generation requirement during peak hours, which offers operational flexibility and financial benefits to utility. In the literature, DSM has been used in residential, commercial, and industrial sectors. However, the existing techniques do not explicitly consider the low-income consumers when TOU scheme is utilised. It may result in financial repercussion for these consumers. To overcome this challenge, a TOU scheme is proposed in this paper by ensuring financial benefits for all types of residential consumers and utility. To this end, an optimisation model is formulated by taking into account the various consumer groups such as low-income, middle-income and high-income. Two different meters (meter 1 and meter 2) are prudently allocated to these consumers. Using genetic algorithm technique, optimisation model is solved to provide electricity tariff and block sizes for various consumers under two meters. The proposed algorithm is applied to the residential inhabitants of a practical distribution system in Bangladesh. The results suggest that significant amount of annual savings can be achieved simultaneously by consumers and utility. The low-income consumers remain financially least affected while the proposed TOU tariff scheme is executed. In addition, the proposed TOU approach is compared to existing methods and found that optimisation based TOU outperforms the conventional ones. \u00a9 2021 The Authors", "2021"]

Successful implementation of appliance control and automation can alleviate network peak demand and improve distributed photovoltaic (D-PV) self-consumption to reduce its network voltage and reverse power flow impacts. Domestic electric water heating (DEWH) systems are widely deployed globally and have one of the highest peak power draw and overall energy consumption of household appliances. DEWH storage tanks offer large thermal energy storage capacity which can be used for shifting demand to lower demand periods. With growing D-PV deployment, they also offer the opportunity to store excess generation that would be otherwise exported to the grid. In this work, an intelligent water heating control tool (IWHC) is developed to store excess D-PV generation in DEWH storage tanks as thermal energy, according to the D-PV generation characteristics, household electricity consumption, hot water draw (HWD) patterns, and real time energy monitoring. The IWHC tool was installed and tested in nine Australian households with D-PV and DEWH systems. For performance comparison, two other commercially available control tools, timer, and diverter, were installed and tested in eleven other households with D-PV and DEWH systems. For each control tool, energy simulation models were developed, and the collected field performance data was used to validate the models. The validated simulation models were extended to a broader set of 380 Australian households with a year of D-PV, household and DEWH electricity consumption data. The results indicate that, on average, households can utilize 2.4 kWh, 1.8 kWh and 3.4 kWh of daily excess D-PV generation for water heating, using the IWHC, timer and diverter, respectively.

Instead of adjusting the supply, improving the demand response (DR) can be a more efficient way to optimize power balance. HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning) systems, which operate on the demand side of power-grids, have a huge potential to improve the power balance. To assess their potential in a variable air volume (VAV) air-conditioning system with energy storage tank we introduce a demand response method that combines active cool-energy storage (ACES) with global temperature adjustment (GTA). To confirm the effectiveness of this combined ACES+GTA approach, we conduct measurements with the help of a full-scale VAV air-conditioning test setup. The experimental results are compared with a TRNSYS simulation. The measurements indicate that an energy-storing water-tank can effectively reduce the number of starts and stops for the heat pump. The simulation confirms that the ACES+GTA method can also effectively reduce the peak load of the power grid with little impact on the thermal comfort of the energy consumers.

With the sizes of systems rising, centralized optimization methods are restricted by their complexities of communications, while distributed optimization methods have emerged as a powerful tool for dealing with increasingly complex systems. However, convergence rates of some widely used distributed optimization methods, such as the standard alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), still have room for improvement. In this paper, a parallel and distributed optimization method for energy management of microgrids (MGs) is proposed to boost the convergence rate without sacrificing the accuracy of the optima, in which agents calculate, exchange and update in parallel. At first, a decomposition method is presented, where the objective functions and constraints of an original optimization problem with separable variables are decomposed into local objective functions and constraints for agents, which is the key to our method. Further, agents solve their local optimization problems independently and then exchange determined optima with their neighbors. Finally, the method is evaluated to solve economic dispatch with demand response for microgrids. The simulation results show that compared to the standard ADMM, for a given accuracy, the number of iterations in our method is only one third or even less than that of ADMM. Furthermore, our method can minimize the cost functions of distributed generation on supply side and maximize the profit functions of flexible loads on the demand side.  \u00a9 2010-2012 IEEE.", "2021"]

A building's HVAC devices are controlled by automation and control systems consisting of basic and supervisory control layers. Local discrete-mode controllers of HVAC system devices, which receive control signals proposed by a supervisory control method, cause a performance gap between these control layers. Here, we study the performance gap of discrete-mode controllers and examine how such controllers can maintain set-points, using simulation studies developed in the TRNSYS software environment. Considering a set of different devices operating within one room to manage its indoor air temperature and quality, we show that coordination of their discrete-mode controllers may yield a sizeable, larger than 10%, reduction of the heat use and average thermal load. However, such coordination may also entail indoor comfort violation, meaning that there should be a trade-off between comfort and energy performance. We propose controlled adjustments of indoor microclimate parameters to manage heat use (kWh) and thermal load (kW) within demand-side management programs. According to our simulation studies for discrete-mode controllers, the heat use and average thermal load may be reduced by up to 14.1%, ceding the indoor temperature set-point profile by 1 \u00b0C and the proportion of fresh air in the room by 50%. Hence, the controlled adjustments of various indoor microclimate parameters would be an excellent approach for integrating HVAC system field devices with discrete-mode controllers, and thereby buildings, into future energy networks providing them extra flexibility. \u00a9 2021 The Authors", "2021"]

Utilizing these resources in long-term studies like generation and transmission expansion planning (GTEP) needs long-term modeling. In this article, the GTEP was developed considering long-term model of DRPs using a cooperative game theory approach to minimize the total cost of microgrids (MGs). A two-level decision-making method was used to develop this model. On the top level, investment decisions were cooperatively made by MGs and a stochastic chance-constrained mixed integer linear programming formulation was modeled for investment decisions with operational uncertainties on the bottom level. The self-sufficiency index was also considered that guarantees supply of sensitive loads in islanding mode. Effectiveness of the proposed model was shown by numerical studies in three cases where in Case\u00a01, load of each smart MG (SMG) will be supplied using its own resources and trading with the retail market. In Case\u00a02, SMGs can also trade with each other in non-cooperative (profitable) approach and in Case\u00a03, SMGs can trade with each other in cooperative approach. The total cost of SMGs was decreased in Case\u00a02 compared to the previous case by 2.62%, which was due to the use of other SMGs' resources to provide load. Also, the total cost of SMGs was decreased in Case\u00a03 compared to the two previous cases (2.92% and 0.3% decrease compared to the Cases\u00a01 and 2, respectively), which was due to cooperative approach taken by SMGs in this case.

The reliance on existing Earth System Model outputs limits the ability to explore feedbacks under arbitrary scenarios and equally important limits the ability to explore large-scale uncertainty in these interactions. In this study we explore a wide range of climate uncertainties and incorporate the implications of increased cooling hydrofluorocarbons emissions. We implement a statistical relationship between global mean temperature change and heating and cooling degree days that allows us to produce changes in building energy demands within GCAM at every time step and every region. While there is a general agreement in the literature that increasing temperatures will increase cooling energy demands and decrease heating energy demands, there has been no fully-coupled analysis of this dynamic that would, for example, account for the feedbacks on hydrofluorocarbons from increased cooling demands. The variation in the spatial distribution of temperatures leads to substantial variation in the change in cooling and heating energy across regions, with regions like USA, India and Sub-Saharan Africa experiencing a factor of two difference in cooling demands.

Assuming a fixed configuration of distribution network, DR programs usually optimize the generation cost by encouraging the consumers to reduce their energy demands. Whereas reconfiguration of network is done for a pre-defined generation schedule and energy demand. However, separate incorporation of these two operational techniques in the EM problem may lead to a non-optimal solution. In this paper, a joint framework is proposed to integrate a novel incentive-based DR program and reconfiguration method in the EM problem of microgrid on a day-ahead time frame. The objective of the work is to minimize the fuel cost of conventional distributed generation (DG) and the cost of power purchased from the grid, while maximizing the profit for microgrid operator (MGO).

This paper contributes on two fronts \u2013 to explicate householders and practitioner's perceptions of DR: disjunctions between these perceptions and its implications for the acceptance of residential DR. Using a co-production approach, this paper draws insights from two sets of stakeholders in India - 25 DR policy and utility experts and 24 household consumers. Our results show that technological saviourism pervasively underscores practitioners understanding of DR and householder agency, a crucial factor in the adoption of DR at the residential scale remains a missing piece. The paper concludes that without considering householder agency, delivering a decarbonised future based on demand response will be challenging and consumers may remain locked into-existing socio-cultural practices that negate the adoption of DR. \u00a9 2021 The Author(s)", "2021"]

In 2019, we implemented stated preference experiments to estimate households' preferences for improved electricity supply in a nationally representative sample of urban households, covering 42 cities in Ethiopia. In the first split-sample experiment, we presented respondents with a contingent valuation (CV) scenario that alternatively elicited their willingness to pay (WTP) for reduced evening-time power outages, or their willingness to accept (WTA) compensation for increased disruptions. Then, we implemented a discrete choice experiment with the same respondents to understand preferences for the frequency, duration and time of a day attributes of outages, as well as the value of advanced notification. The results from the CV survey show that household WTP is approximately 40 birr (US$1.4) for a three-hour reduction of duration in power outages in the evening and that WTA is 42 birr (US$1.4) for a similar increase in the duration of outages during that period. The choice experiment meanwhile reveals that household WTP is 11 birr (US$0.4) for a one-unit reduction in the number of outages and 53 birr (US$1.8) to avoid daytime or nighttime outages relative to morning outages, on average. Households prefer a day prior outage notification to a week prior notification, with a marginal WTP of 23 birr (US$0.8). Information about the value of such outage attributes can help inform strategies that better address electricity consumers' preferences and needs. We finally discussed the relationship between energy poverty and preferences for improved electricity supply. \u00a9 2021 The Authors", "2021"]

While machine learning is becoming more powerful, the models developed, especially artificial neural networks like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), are becoming more complex, resulting in \u201cdarker models\u201d with lower model interpretability. The sophisticated inference mechanism behind machine learning prevents ordinary building professionals from understanding the models, thereby lowering trust in the predictions made. To address this, attention mechanisms have been widely implemented to improve the interpretability of deep learning; these mechanisms enable a deep learning-based model to track how different inputs influence outputs at each step of inference. This paper proposes a novel neural network architecture with an attention mechanism for developing RNN-based building energy prediction, and investigates the effectiveness of this attention mechanism in improving the interpretability of RNN models developed for 24-hour ahead building cooling load prediction. To better understand, explain and evaluate these neural network-based building energy prediction models, the obtained attention vectors (or metric) are used to visualize the influence of different parts of model inputs on the prediction result. This helps the users to understand why predictions are made by the model, as well as how input sequences proportionally influence the output sequences. Further analysis of attention vectors can provide interesting temporal information for understanding building thermal dynamics, like the thermal inertia of the building. The proposed attention-based architecture can be implemented in developing optimal operation control strategies and improving demand and supply management. The model developed based on this architecture is assessed using real building operational data, and shows improved accuracy and interpretability over baseline models (without adopting attention mechanisms). The research results help to bridge the gap between building professionals and advanced machine learning techniques. The insights obtained can be used as guidance for the development, fine-tuning, explanation and debugging of data-driven building energy prediction models. \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd", "2021"]

The retailer equipped with an energy hub seeks to maximize its profit by managing multiple types of energy, e.g., electricity, natural gas, heat, cold, etc. We model the energy management problem as a stochastic optimization problem with a risk-sensitive cost. In the proposed model, a chance constraint relating the supply and demand balance is introduced to capture the generation and demand uncertainties simultaneously. In addition, risk of the retailer's energy management profit is incorporated using the Markowitz framework to trade off the risk and the expected profit due to uncertainties. To tackle the intractable chance constraint, we first relax the problem to a risk-only minimization problem with guaranteed expected return. The analytical solution is obtained using the Karush\u2013Kuhn\u2013Tucker optimality conditions. A distributionally robust optimization method is further adopted to avoid dependencies on probability distribution information of uncertainties, and convert the original problem into a tractable second-order conic programming problem. Simulation results show that our method can drastically shift electricity loads from peak hours to off-peak periods of the day thereby reducing the peak load demand.

A detailed techno-economic and environmental potential of hybridized energy systems with the pumped hydro storage are examined over conventional battery storage and diesel-only systems. The study also investigates the effects of uncertainty of renewable resources, load data, and hydro resources on the sizing of the hybrid system. Results revealed that the study area has the potential renewable resources (PV/Wind/Hydro/PHS) for supplying electricity to the community at a significantly lower cost (0.136$/kWh) compared to the diesel-only system (0.355$/kWh). Moreover, the integration of the proposed hybrid system could save 344,106 litres of diesel and 910,459 kg CO2 annually. The study also indicates that PV/Wind/Hydro with the pumped hydro storage reduces the cost of energy and net present cost compared to the battery technology.

Buildings have various flexibility sources that can be effectively utilized for such purposes. According to different requirements of demand responses to power grid on response duration, response direction and response speed (within seconds, minutes, or even longer timescales), building energy flexibility is categorized as fast regulation, moderate regulation, load shedding, load shifting and load covering. In this paper, a comprehensive method is proposed to quantify building energy flexibility based on these categories. Two sets of flexibility indexes (flexibility capacities and flexibility ratios) for the above five energy flexibilities are proposed. An implementation case study is conducted to illustrate the use of these indexes and to validate the effectiveness of using them in flexibility performance assessment of buildings in particular. The impacts of different system design and control parameters on flexibility performance are also investigated quantitatively. The potential economic benefits of utilizing those energy flexibilities are analyzed in a real electricity market with an optimized use of different flexibility sources.

This work models a 100% renewable power system considering 473 climate projections based on IPCC RCP4.5 and 8.5, using Portugal in 2050 as a case study. Five demand-flexibility scenarios are explored, combining different levels of electricity demand and system flexibility. It is found that demand and climate variability are crucial to the planning of power systems. When planning for a median climate, the required capacity varies 3-fold for the range of demand scenarios considered. For the system to be resilient under unfavorable climates, cross-border interconnection power capacity should be doubled while storage should increase up to 200-fold, compared to the system designed for the median climate. Modeling for unfavorable climates leads to +54% renewable power capacity and a 6-fold increase in curtailment of renewable energy generation, thus increasing electricity cost. It is therefore shown that the design of a fully decarbonized power system ought not to be based only on median future climates but should take into account its interannual variability. \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd", "2021"]

Extensive electric vehicle demands at the peak-times, and an increase in electricity consumption due to population growth, have led to higher utility infrastructure investments. Mobile energy hubs i.e. clustered EVs parked in a dedicated location, can be used as an innovative demand-side management solution to reduce long-term utility infrastructure investments.

The results of the study show that the framework developed can minimize lifecycle costs, and improve infrastructure utilization by accounting for the interests of all stakeholders.

Different physical contributions have been considered separately: thermal losses, thermal transients and delay time due to the various costumer distances. This allows estimating the significance of the various phenomena in the estimation of the thermal request, in particular during demand peaks. Results shows that the thermal power required by the thermal plant is significantly different if evaluated relying on a network model or not; in case of thermal peak this is under-estimated up to 20% if the network dynamic is not taken into account. In particular, the inclusion of the thermal transient in the model is found to be crucial for considerably improving the result accuracy in the peak estimation.

While centralized control approaches are easy to achieve global optimum for the scheduling of every DER, they have limitations when dealing with massive number of complex and heterogeneous DERs with time-varying states. Existing decentralized control approaches are mainly based on the assumption that all DERs are completely rational, which is quite far from the reality. In this paper, using a bottom-up approach, we propose a stimulus\u2013response control strategy to realize exploitation of flexibility by VPP. In such a strategy, DERs are dynamically aggregated through autonomous decentralized system, and interact with each other via subscription and publication of topics, regardless of the source and recipient of the messages, thus removing the direct coupling relationship between VPP Operator and DERs. Furthermore, each DER makes an independent decision through edge computing at an agent that has a general End-to-End structure and is driven by the stimulus message received from VPP Operator.

The ability to shift the heat production over time is an important asset to improve the competitiveness of both new and existing networks. To this purpose, the present study evaluates the flexibility potential provided by the water volume enclosed in the network pipelines using the district heating network of Verona (Italy) as a case study. Given the users heat demand in two representative weeks, computer simulations were carried out to calculate the network's thermal response to circulating flow rate variations.

The local temperature drop at the users substations compared to the current situation was used as a relative discomfort indicator. The simulations were carried out using the model NeMo, which has been attached as supplementary material to this publication. The simulation results show that the network pre-charge strategy achieves significant benefits in terms of both peak shaving and load shifting with a limited impact on discomfort for the users.

In this work, we propose an effective day-ahead hourly pricing scheme which depends upon the previous load distribution. We also project real-time prices which are based on day-ahead prices and the difference in the current day's load distribution and previous combined load distribution. The prices are transmitted and implemented via the proposed smart home community controller in smart home community architecture. The simulation results confirm that the proposed pricing scheme minimizes the difference between day-ahead and real-time prices to benefit the end consumer by decreasing their consumption cost. Also, at the same time, the power peak-to-average ratio is reduced, hence maximizing the payoffs of energy generators. \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd", "2021"]

This study explores the commercial viability of using electric vehicles (EVs), recharged by solar minigrids, to provide transport services in off-grid communities. Preliminary findings are presented from a field trial in The Gambia that aims to assess the techno-economic feasibility of integrating sustainable energy and transport infrastructures in sun-rich regions of the Global South. As a dispatchable anchor load, an EV can improve the technical and economic performance of a minigrid by providing demand-side response services. In the developing world, rural communities are often among the poorest, and inadequate transport services remain a major barrier to wealth-creation. Some solutions to this situation may be transferrable to island communities, which share similar challenges in terms of access to energy and fuel. The first of its kind in Africa, this field trial uses an electric minivan, operating from an off-grid village where it has access to a minigrid whose 4.5\u00a0kWp of photovoltaic modules form the roof of a parking shelter for the vehicle. While there, the taxi can recharge, ideally during sunny periods when the photovoltaic array produces surplus power, thus allowing the EV\u2019s battery to recharge while bypassing the minigrid\u2019s own accumulator. This improves system reliability and cost effectiveness, while providing pollution-free energy for the taxi. Ultimately, the intention is to test different vehicles in a variety of circumstances, but this paper outlines only the preliminary findings of the first of these trials. Early results provide convincing new evidence that commercial viability of such a concept is possible in Sub-Saharan Africa. Some promising scenarios for commercial viability are identified, which warrant further investigation, since they suggest that a taxi driver\u2019s earnings could be increased between 250 and 1,300% in local operations, and even 20-fold in tourist markets, depending on vehicle type, minigrid configuration and target market. It is hoped that these may encourage the rollout of solar-recharged EVs where the nexus of sustainable energy and transport systems are likely to make the greatest contribution to addressing the UN\u2019s Sustainable Development Goals, by helping to solve the trilemma of providing energy security, social benefit and environmental sustainability in low-income countries. \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2021 Gammon and Sallah.", "2021"]

However, the strong coupling relationship between hydraulic conditions of each building has brought great difficulties for the operation regulation of DHS. Therefore, an operation strategy based on real-time indoor temperatures was proposed and a new integrated model based on dynamic hydraulic conditions combining with real-time temperatures were developed. The integration model-based strategy selects the operation costs as the main objective function and then a set of optimum neighborhood points were acquired according to the optimum financial point. Finally, the optimum operation solution was determined with consideration of the thermal comfort factor. By this decision-making process, the approach is available to obtain the operation solution which can guarantee a more comfortable indoor environment from energy point of view with a slight increase of financial expenditure.

To achieve the low-carbon transition, financial incentives such as carbon trading are employed in the electricity and natural gas sectors to encourage flexibly emission mitigation to cover the extra carbon costs. However, the existing trading policy applies unilateral mechanism, carbon costs are usually levied on power generation and gas supply companies. Utility companies would simply pass-through the carbon costs to consumers by incorporating them into upward energy prices. Further, due to more than one form of energy consumption in integrated components, there are twofold charges of carbon costs for some consumers in IES. It would be difficult to mitigate carbon emission effectively and efficiently without an equitable trading mechanism. It should be noted that end-use consumers are the underlying drivers of emissions in the energy supply chain. Therefore, this paper proposes a two-stage low-carbon operation planning model based on a bilateral trading mechanism with active demand side management (DSM), aiming to mitigate carbon emissions. The carbon emission flow (CEF) model is applied to track the emissions and calculate the carbon intensities, energy storage systems like battery and power-to-gas (P2G) are considered. The proposed model is tested on a modified IEEE 24-bus electricity system and a modified 20-bus natural gas system. According to the simulation results, the proposed model is effective to reduce carbon intensity by increasing the proportion of energy with low carbon intensity in the energy mix and further achieve carbon emission mitigation. Meanwhile, the demand side can also obtain extra environmental financial benefits by DSM and planned zero-emission facilities under the bilateral trading mechanism. \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd", "2020"]

The green energy technologies (GETs) have become a potential alternative to increase energy efficiency, maximise the use of RERs and significantly reduce the operation of the diesel generator (DG). In view of this, this research work proposes an optimal power solution that comprises of the dynamic load, wind turbine generator (WTG), battery storage system (BSS), photovoltaic (PV) and DG. The energy management scheme is proposed in the study to coordinate the power sharing among the significant constituents of a MGS. The fmincon programming function is applied to explore local RERs for the benefits of customers at the demand side and to increase access to a continuous power supply. The objective of the proposed approach is to minimise the total cost (TC), minimise cost of energy (COE), maximise the benefit to cost ratio (BCR), maximise the application of RERs and minimise the operations of the DG and BSS. The variations of the power demand in spring, winter, autumn and summer are considered as the prerequisites to assess the operational efficiency of the power system. The outcomes of the research work established the fact that the proposed scheme can achieve a substantial reduction in the fuel cost (FC), maintenance cost (MC) and emission cost (EC) because the DG is only switched on when the power from RERs is not adequate to satisfy the power requirement. This indicates that the PV and WTG operate with great potentials to achieve cost savings and improve the performance of an off-grid MGS. The outcomes of this research work will provide significant information to the independent power providers (IPPs) and microgrid operators (MGOs) to make appropriate decisions while planning and designing their power systems.

Nevertheless, most existing literatures focus on restoring loads by optimally dispatching distributed generators (DGs), where the controllability on the demand side is usually neglected. Moreover, unbalances in the restored microgrids should be limited in specified levels to prevent DGs from tripping to enhance the operational reliability. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel method to restore a distribution system into multiple microgrids whilst taking the three-phase demand-side management (T-DSM) into account. The T-DSM exploits optimal phase positions of switchable loads to alleviate the unbalance issue from the demand side, which can be coordinated with network partition and DG dispatching to improve the controllability of microgrids during the restoration process.

Large disparities among provinces in private vehicle ownership, sufficiency of public transport infrastructure, affordability of clean fuel vehicles, etc. highlight the importance of regionally tailored mitigation strategies to fully exploit carbon reduction potentials. We classify 31 provinces in mainland China into three regional clusters based on their passenger transport development level, then establish a provincial level bottom-up model to project energy demand and CO2 emissions of China's passenger transport sector by 2050. Mitigation effects of improving vehicle energy efficiency, shifting to alternative clean fuels, and promoting public transport are compared, and regionally tailored policy priorities are then proposed. The results show that CO2 emissions of China's passenger transport sector will peak around 2045 at 647 MtCO2 and slightly declined to 642 MtCO2 in 2050 in the Current Policies Scenario.

The added costs incurred by consumers are mainly paying for the peak-load demand and the system's operation and maintenance. Thus, developing and utilizing an efficient HEMS would provide an opportunity both to the end-users and system operators to reduce their costs. Accordingly, this paper proposes an effective HEMS design for the self-scheduling of assets of a residential end-user.

The development and utilization of renewable energy can realize the transformation of regional economic development mode and promote the long-term sustainable development of regional economy. One of the latest concepts that has attracted a lot of attention in the power systems is the energy hub (EH). In this paper, a combined energy system (CES) known as the EH consisting of electrical, cooling and heating equipment along with the demand response programs (DRPs) as well as renewable energy resources (RERs) optimization study have been proposed. Moreover, the uncertainty modeling and electrical scenario creation of cooling, heating, wind speed, solar irradiation and the energy carriers prices including electricity and natural gas is presented. The objective of the optimization problem is maximizing the profit of the EH with the existence of DRPs and RERs under four scenarios which is solved by enhanced grey wolf optimization (GWO) algorithm. In order to avoid such deficiencies and to realize a stabilized relationship between exploration and exploitation, a new modified grey wolf optimization (MGWO) algorithm is proposed. The implementation results show high accuracy and power levels of this method to solve the aforementioned problem under different uncertain parameters and various scenarios. The simulation results of proposed EH profit maximization model shows a reduction in purchased electricity from the main grid and a reduction of the overall operation costs. \u00a9 2020", "2021"]

This study estimates the efficiency of Ghanaian households' electricity consumption and factors influencing inefficiency using the energy demand frontier model and data from the seventh round of the Ghana Living Standards Survey. The results indicate that income is inelastic to electricity demand while price elasticity to demand is inversely related. Appliance ownership, number of rooms, location and ecological zones significantly affected electricity demand. The mean efficiency score is 63.0% for the entire sample and, 69.9% and 66.3% for rural and urban households respectively, suggesting the existence of an immense potential for implementation of energy efficiency measures. Factors that negatively influence efficiency included education, ageing and power outages. Households living in bungalows and apartments are less efficient compared to those in compound houses possibly because of self-monitoring behaviour. Compared to very poor households, poor and non-poor households are less efficient in electricity consumption while public sector employees are less energy efficient compared to the unemployed.

Nevertheless, the integration of Variable Renewable Energy Sources (vRES) into the electricity grid are already causing technical problems to island grids thus making grid flexibility a key topic. In the past, since power plants were completely manageable while the load was unpredictable, the grid flexibility was supplied by traditional power plants; but now, due to vRES, the variability and unpredictability has moved to the generation side and the opposite shift has happened to flexibility agents. This paper deals with solutions that improve the ability of the grid to cope with vRES unpredictability such as energy storage technologies and all the solutions offered by sector coupling strategies. Particularly, this research focus on solutions that deals with such solutions in the insular contexts. Several solutions have been presented concluding that battery energy systems and pumped hydro energy storage are the most used technologies in islands.

The real-time pricing (RTP) mechanism based on demand response (DR) is an ideal method for DSM, which can achieve supply\u2013demand balance and maximize social welfare in the future. This paper proposes a hierarchical market framework to address RTP between the power supplier and multi-microgrids (MMGs). Firstly, an expectation bilevel model is proposed to adjust the energy scheduling of MMGs, including uncertain loads, multi-energy-supply and storage devices,etc. In the proposed bilevel model, the upper level aims to maximize the profit of the power supplier, while the lower level is formulated to maximize the expectation of total welfares for MMGs. Then, the lower level is transformed into a deterministic optimization problem by mathematical techniques. To solve the model, a hybrid algorithm-called distributed PSO-BBA, is put forward by combining the particle swarm optimization (PSO) and the branch and bound algorithm (BBA). In this algorithm, the PSO and BBA are employed to address the subproblems of upper and lower levels, respectively. Finally, simulations on several situations show that the proposed distributed RTP method is applicable and effective under uncertainties, and can reduce the computational complexity as well. The results show that the hierarchical energy dispatch framework is not only more reasonable but also can increase the profits of power suppliers and the welfare of MGs effectively. \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd", "2020"]

In many countries the winter peak hours coincide with the early evening hours and therefore replacing the electric heaters with TW systems during these hours would facilitate the peak clipping strategy in DSM. The aim of the current work is to offer means of overcoming the difficulties concerned with the implementation of such a DSM program and developing a comprehensive method to determine whether the outlined DSM program can be economically justifiable. The proposed method is examined under the North Cyprus (NC) conditions. According to the simulations performed for a 35 m2 room, integrated with a TW, an estimated 355.35 kWh of electricity is saved in each house participating in the program during the peak hours in winter. A peak clipping of 17.5-MW is expected to be achieved with 6842 houses. If a rebate of 1588.25 EUR is invested by the utility per house, a net present value of 5,031,514 EUR is estimated over a life time of 20 years. The life cycle cost indicators under different conditions and risks that might befall during the project implementation are also investigated.

By integrating recent advances in optimization and statistical modeling, the NAC model can provide an accurate hour-ahead forecast of the gas flow at all of the distribution points in the network. By detecting the influential nodes of the dynamic network, taking into account that demand and supply have to be balanced, the forecast can be used to compute an optimized schedule and resource allocation.

Low-temperature district heating is a key technology for energy-efficient urban heat supply as it supports an efficient utilization of low-grade waste-heat and renewable heat sources. The low operating temperature for such grids facilitates the integration of seasonal thermal energy storage, enabling a high degree of operational flexibility in the utilization of both uncontrollable and controllable heat sources.

Energy storage systems and demand response programs (DRPs) are regarded as essential tools to optimally solve these problems. In this paper, an improved residential micro energy grid (MEG) is proposed to decrease the operation cost and emissions by integrating combined cooling, heating and power (CCHP), photovoltaic (PV) units, wind turbine (WT) units, a pumped-storage unit, heating storage, and cooling storage. Due to the disadvantages of batteries, such as short life, high investment cost, detriment to the environment, and difficult maintenance, investors are sometimes unwilling to choose batteries for electricity storage, in which case pumped-storage units are often selected as an alternative. For better performance on the demand side, price- and incentive-based DRPs are employed to reduce the operation cost and maintain reliability during the high load period. Also, the uncertainties of wind speed, solar radiation, electricity price, and electrical load are taken into account to gain more accurate results by using a scenario-based methodology.

The proposed AppLeBill idea offers a billing strategy such that time-shiftable appliances (TSAs) in a residence may have a separate billing rate rather than a single billing rate for total electricity usage. The proposed AppLeBill concept includes three different schemes which are explained and simulated in order to compare each other in terms of their potential benefits. \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd", "2020"]

This paper presents the use of an active PCM storage system in buildings and evaluates its energy performance over the different seasons. To this end, two experimental huts, each equipped with solar and electric heaters in winter or an air conditioning unit in summer, were used to investigate the concept. Also, one of the huts was provided with PCM storage units, and the results obtained were compared with those collected from the reference hut. A CompactRIO, data acquisition system, powered by LabVIEW real-time software, was used to transfer data for analysis, processing, and communicating with the host computer. In this research, the active PCM storage units could store solar energy in cold seasons or free night cooling in warm seasons for later use and hence reduce the heating/cooling load requirements. An accumulative heating energy savings of 40% in May and 10.3% in June/July 2019, were achieved. The use of PCM for space cooling also led to an accumulative energy-saving of 30% in March/April and 10% in January. \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd", "2020"]

One of the important contributions of this research is to explore the role of overall structural change and economic factors for renewable and cleaner energy in developed and emerging economies. The existing literature points to scant research about the impacts of economic complexity on energy transformation and renewable energy adoption. During recent years, the G7 and E7 countries have encountered enormous competition in manufacturing and industrialization and are also experiencing global pressure from both climate change and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for the promotion of renewable energy infrastructure. Taking into consideration the heterogeneity of issues, the authors apply the Westerlund cointegration and heterogeneous panel data techniques (FGLS, system GMM, FMOLS, and DOLS) for an in-depth, empirical analysis. Interestingly, empirical findings indicate that economic complexity affects renewable energy demand from G7 and E7 countries.

The weather-dependent, non-dispatchable nature of renewable resources decreases the ability of operators to match supply with demand. Concurrently, distributed energy resources, defined as small-scale loads, generation sources, and storage systems, are becoming ubiquitous within modern electrical systems. This literature review presents the grid services that utilities use to alleviate power systems reliability concerns, particularly those caused by renewable resources, and how aggregations of residential-scale distributed energy resources can be used to provide these services. By aggregating distributed energy resources en masse to provide grid services, grid operators can concurrently improve reliability while ensuring high penetration levels of renewable resources. Academic researchers have developed the theoretical methods for achieving these objectives. Standards bodies have created open communication frameworks for linking these resources with grid operators. And, large-scale utility programs have demonstrated the potential for providing grid services using aggregations of these resources.

However, people are prone to habits and regularity, so this kind of dynamic pricing schemes may also impose a greater cost of reacting to price incentives. In a randomized field experiment we compare the household consumer welfare effects of reacting to dynamic electricity price incentives to those of reacting to time of use incentives. We utilized smart-metered hourly electricity consumption data to unobtrusively measure treatment effects. We found that a dynamic incentive of 1 DKK/kWh induced an average change in electricity consumption per household of 0.182 kWh during the 3-hour target period. The corresponding time of use incentive induced an average change in electricity consumption of 0.351 kWh. This implies that dynamic incentives reduce consumer surplus from reacting by half, compared to reacting to corresponding time of use incentives and therefore that households derive a substantial welfare benefit from the regularity and predictability provided by time of use pricing. This suggests that the tariff structure that optimally balances demand flexibility and the associated consumer welfare costs is likely a combination of time of use and dynamic pricing incentives. \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd", "2021"]

However, to our knowledge, none of the existing works considers clearing both energy and reserve via a P2P market mechanism in order to compensate for the uncertainty originating from renewable generation and allocate the reserve cost induced by uncertainty fairly.

We model the renewable generation uncertainty by versatile distribution and determine the required reserve based on a chance-constrained optimization approach. Then, a fully decentralized P2P market based on consensus alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) theory is proposed.

Improving the consumption rate of DER is currently one of the important research contents of the home energy management system (HEMS). How to better coordinate household appliances to participate in the HEMS, so as to improve the situation is the focus of this paper. Due to the development of artificial intelligence and communication technology, we establish a household appliance optimization scheduling system. According to the household electricity-using habits, most household appliances are divided into three categories. Based on this, we propose a HEMS model, which aims to minimize the peak load and electricity cost of a smart home, and achieve single-objective and multi-objective optimization. In order to better implement the research of DER, the solar radiation data of one day in summer in Shanghai is used to compare with different capacities of photovoltaic energy storage system (PESS). Because the variables in the model are mostly binary or decimal integers, it is essentially a mixed integer programming (MIP). Therefore, a simulator has been implemented in the MATLAB software environment to facilitate the solution of proposed HEMS. The results show that the configuration of PESS is beneficial to the optimal scheduling of household appliances. In the single objective optimization, the peak load and electricity cost of scheme 4 is decreased by 61.51% and 71.39% compared with scheme 1, respectively. Besides, Pareto front is the most ideal in multi-objective optimization under scheme 4, and Pareto solutions distribution are more uniform, which can provide more scheduling choices for residential users.

Based on household appliances TOU, the absolute satisfaction derived from the preferences of appliance and power ratings, the GWASA can produce optimum energy consumption pattern that will give the customer maximum satisfaction at the predefined user budget.

This work uses the load data collected from a department in an institution located in Southern India based on user satisfaction to manage the load through peak shifting strategy in DSM technique. The load pattern before and after DSM implementation is supplied in an economical way through the utilization of renewable energy resources along with the existing grid connection. Optimization analysis is performed with the help of Hybrid Optimization of Multiple Energy Resources (HOMER) simulation software for a different combination which includes PV with grid, PV-Diesel with grid and PV-Hydrogen fuel with grid. Of the various results obtained from simulation, the best configuration is selected based on Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA).

The volatile nature of these resources, uncertainties associated with the time-varying load, and market prices impose the significance of an efficient energy management system (EMS). So far, the MG optimal operation has been referred to optimize the operating costs only. However, the prospects of incorporating demand-side management (DSM) with the EMS problem and its effect on total operating cost and peak reduction is needed to be evaluated.

The paper also presents an initial analysis of the dataset in terms of three heating efficiency indicators, namely 1) Annual heating energy use intensity, 2) Daily heat load variation, and 3) Cooling efficiency. The overall finding was that building typologies perform significantly different from one another concerning indicators 1 and 2, but not for indicator 3. It is therefore not possible to declare one building typology more efficient than the other as this depends on the building construction year and the considered efficiency indicator. The data indicate that further energy-efficiency improvements of the existing building stock are essential to the realization of 4th Generation District Heating technologies in Denmark and that these improvements most likely will lead to increased heat load variations that need to be addressed, for instance by enabling a larger degree of demand-side flexibility in the existing district heating systems.

This study investigated the energy flexibility of a net-zero energy (NZE) house using a solar-assisted air conditioning system with integrated thermal energy storage (TES) and demand-side management (DSM) strategies. The main contribution is to investigate and reveal the interactions among the utilisation of solar energy, thermal energy storage, and DSM strategies, to improve building energy flexibility. A simulation system of the NZE house was first developed using TRNSYS. A total of 40 alternative designs of the solar-assisted air conditioning system with TES were formulated by exhausting the combination of the photovoltaic/thermal (PV/T) collectors and a phase change material TES unit, and four DSM strategies including over-heating/cooling, pre-heating/cooling, temperature set-point relaxation, and heat pump charging TES. The results showed that heat pump solar contribution (i.e. the ratio of the energy consumption provided by PV to its total energy consumption) of 0.79 was achieved by using DSM strategies. Using TES unit could further increase solar contribution to nearly 1.0. The influence of the temperature set-point relaxation and over-heating/cooling strategies on energy flexibility was negligible when the over-heating/cooling and/or heat pump charging TES were used. The 1% peak grid import was mostly contributed by the appliances when the designs with high energy flexibility were used.

Findings: A strong empirical evidence in favor of energy dependence and growth hypothesis in the investigated SSA countries was found. The finding that real sector value added and overall growth rate adjust reasonably to the shocks and dynamics of the energy consumption variables makes energy consumption an enabler for growth.

Producers in China need to consider factor prices, outputs, and EIT constraint while they plan the number of input factors. Therefore, this article brings the EIT into the conditional input demand function of an input factor and assesses the impacts of the elasticity of substitution between different production factors. By building two-factor substitution elasticity models with and without EIT constraints, this paper examines the impacts of EIT constraint on the elasticity of substitution between input factors in both the fossil fuel production sector and the non-fossil-fuel production sector. The main conclusions are, firstly, EIT constraint influences both own-price elasticity of an input factor and cross-price elasticity between different input factors. Secondly, EIT constraint hinders the responses of some input factors to the price changes of other input factors, and changes relationships between some input factors from complementary to substitute, or vice versa. Two policy implications are obtained. First, producers should consider the impacts of EIT constraint on their investment, labor input, energy input, and raw materials purchase and bring these impacts into their business strategies. Second, reducing energy input by changing prices of other production factors will be ineffective under EIT constraint. \u00a9 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.", "2021"]

This paper addresses this knowledge gap by presenting a fundamental energy flexibility quantification framework applicable to various energy systems commonly found in residential buildings (i.e., heat pumps, renewables, thermal and electrical storage systems). Using this framework, the interactions between these systems are analysed, as well as assessing the net energy cost of providing flexibility arising from demand response actions where onsite electricity production is present. A calibrated white-box model of a residential building developed using EnergyPlus (including inter alia a ground source heat pump, a battery storage system, and an electric vehicle) is utilised. To acquire daily energy flexibility mappings, hourly independent, and consecutive demand response actions are imposed for each energy system, using the proposed indicators. The obtained flexibility maps give insights into both the energy volumes associated with demand response actions and qualitative characteristics of the modulated electricity consumption curves. The flexibility potential of each studied energy system is determined by weather and occupant thermal comfort preferences as well as the use of appliances, lighting, etc. Finally, simulations show that zone and water tank thermostat modulations can be suitably combined to shift rebound occurrences away from peak demand periods. These insights can be used by electricity aggregators to evaluate a portfolio of buildings or optimally harness the flexibility of each energy system to shift peak demand consumption to off-peak periods or periods of excess onsite electricity generation. \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd", "2021"]

This work investigates the potentials of CI in demand side management (DSM) in urban areas. CI is used to control the energy performance of representative groups of buildings in Stockholm, aiming to increase the demand flexibility and climate resilience in the urban scale. CI-DSM is developed based on a simple communication strategy among buildings, using forward (1) and backward (0) signals, corresponding to applying and disapplying the adaptation measure, which is extending the indoor temperature range. A simple platform and algorithm are developed for modelling CI-DSM, considering two timescales of 15 min and 60 min. Three climate scenarios are used to represent typical, extreme cold and extreme warm years in Stockholm. Several indicators are used to assess the performance of CI-DSM, including Demand Flexibility Factor (DFF) and Agility Factor (AF), which are defined explicitly for this work. According to the results, CI increases the autonomy and agility of the system in responding to climate shocks without the need for computationally extensive central decision making systems. CI helps to gradually and effectively decrease the energy demand and absorb the shock during extreme climate events. Having a finer control timescale increases the flexibility and agility on the demand side, resulting in a faster adaptation to climate variations, shorter engagement of buildings, faster return to normal conditions and consequently a higher climate resilience. \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd", "2021"]

Hence, industrial customers with flexible loads are attractive targets for implementing demand-side management (DSM) programs. In recent years, Iranian energy ministry has applied an industrial operational reserve program (IORP) to reduce energy shortage during peak hours. This program has been developed to encourage industrial customers to participate in DSM programs, while steel plants show fewer tendencies to take part in these programs. In this paper, a techno-economic feasibility analysis of implementing IORP on steel plants, as the largest consumers of Iran\u2019s industrial sector, is presented. For this purpose, first, the production process of a steel plant is modeled. Then, an optimization problem is developed to obtain the optimal scheduling of processes involved in producing steel through considering their technical and economic aspects. In order to solve the proposed problem which is mixed-integer nonlinear, Benders decomposition approach is used. Eventually, from the viewpoint of a steel plant owner, the profitability of taking part in IORP is investigated in three possible scenarios.

There are a few alternatives to comprehensively solve these problems with an emphasis on economic and environmental sustainability. In this paper, individual heat pumps and energy efficiency measures are analyzed in four scenarios to investigate their role for cleaner and sufficient heating in rural settings. From a high-level perspective, this paper assesses the potential for electricity demand flexibility based on the use of individual heat pumps equipped with hot water storage. Methods: In a first step, the current annual residential heating energy consumption of a rural area in Hungary is estimated with a bottom-up model using data from field surveys and official datasets. In a second step, four scenarios estimate the future heating energy consumption considering demographic trends and the average number of building retrofits (thermal insulation) performed yearly in the region. Results: The reference scenario is a 20-year projection of heating energy consumption with modest retrofit actions which resulted in small energy savings. Alternative scenarios based on more effective retrofit actions reaching higher rates of the building stock would result in a 23\u201369% reduction in final energy consumption. Phasing out lignite from the heating energy mix would reduce particulate matter emissions. Each well-insulated dwelling with a heat pump-based system and hot water storage tank could provide theoretical flexibility of approximately 3.4 kWh per 24\u00a0h. Conclusions: The current energy retrofit practices are not sufficient to solve the challenges faced in this area. Demand-side management policies based on the widespread use of individual heat pumps are an alternative to promote access to cleaner residential heating. An additional benefit is the potential for flexibility in electricity demand. Thus, this paper calls for an integration of energy retrofit with efficient heating (including hot water storage tank) to achieve results that further contribute to a future of sustainable energy. \u00a9 2020, The Author(s).", "2020"]

This approach corresponds to a time-of-use solution which is an indirect method, based on prices, for inducing demand modifications on consumers. An aggregator of EV fleet acts as a dealer between an electricity market and consumers. The EV aggregator is a price-taker agent from the wholesale electricity market viewpoint and price designer when selling energy to consumers. A game-theoretical model based on a Stackelberg formulation is proposed to capture the interactions between the fleet operator and electric vehicle owners, avoiding the requirement of a price elasticity model for the EV clusters. The interaction between the agents is formulated as a bi-level optimization problem: At the upper-level, the aggregator maximizes its benefits whereas the lower-level represents the dynamic behaviour of rational drivers as a fleet. The EV operator faces uncertainty in wholesale prices when buying energy and when forecasting consumption behaviour, then random parameters are modelled in a scenario framework. The model performance is evaluated through a case study using historical data from car-sharing services in Italy, comparing the result with a fixed-prices model. It is shown that the proposed price-based scheme allows to increment the aggregator profit with respect to a fixed-price contract, producing also a load shifting effect in the charging profile of the fleet. \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd", "2021"]

In this study, mutual information (MI) was used as a tool to quantitatively analyze energy consumption fluctuations due to information interaction differences. First, a building energy system to cool an office building was constructed as a planning model. Meanwhile, three control strategies were developed to control the heat pump and the room temperature. Subsequently, uniform distribution error was used to simulate information interaction deviation during the control phase. Finally, the robustness of the three control strategies was quantified using MI. When MI reached 88.6% of the design phase, the energy consumption and renewable energy usage of the second control strategy were closest to the design phase. Moreover, out of 100 simulation sets with added errors, the second strategy exhibited 10% greater acceptable simulation sets than the other two strategies.

Our results show that the target can be achieved by combining at least two of the categories of drivers. However, it is noteworthy that the technological category, which has by far the lowest level of barriers, almost reaches the target largely owing to the high impact for single-family houses, showing the crucial role of changes in the technology mix.

The cost of the electrical energy demanded by the factory during the production can be greater than 20% of the overall cost. This kind of arc-furnace allows the production of steel with levels of scrap metal feedstock up to 100%. From an electrical point of view, the factory size in terms of its maximum apparent power demanded from the grid is designed to make use of the static capacity of the transmission line that supplies the energy. In that case, it is not possible to increase the power of the factory above the static rating by adding new facilites without installing new transmission infrastructures. This paper presents a methodology that allows an increase in net power of an arc-furnace factory without installing new transmission lines.

Residential microgrid is a dynamic and complex cyber-physical system, which consists of multiple cooperative, non-cooperative and even conflicting entities. Random and separate demand-side management of the multiple entities may have detrimental effects on the grid reliability like the peak \u201crebound\u201d issue and on the economic benefits for both utilities and consumers.

Stealth democracy represents an established view on the role of citizens in energy policy making: the energy sector has traditionally been presented as a technocratic domain reserved for experts and businessmen. By contrast, political consumerism can be seen as an expression of \u201cenergy democracy\u201d. Design/methodology/approach: The data is based on a postal survey and an internet survey that were conducted in 2016 among a random sample representing Finns who were between 18 and 75 years. The dependence of the support for demand response and prosumerism on the endorsement of political consumerism and stealth democracy will be tested statistically (Pearson chi-square). Findings: The endorsement of demand response mainly depended statistically on citizens\u2019 attitudes towards political consumerism and stealth democracy. However, comparing electricity prices and changing electricity suppliers did not depend on adherence to political consumerism and stealth democracy. Nevertheless, in these cases, support was higher among the supporters of political consumerism than among supporters of stealth democracy. By contrast, the endorsement of prosumerism, for instance, in terms of factors that influence citizens\u2019 decisions to invest in electricity generation in their households, depended statistically on citizens\u2019 attitudes on political consumerism and stealth democracy. Research limitations/implications: It might be that the variables used in this study to measure stealth democracy are not specific enough. More generally, Finns\u2019 willingness to support for stealth democracy may be based on or at least encouraged by the misunderstandings of democratic politics: more information is needed on the level of knowledge that citizens have about normative principles of democratic decision-making processes. Practical implications: The implication of this study for energy policy making is that there are (at least in Finland) good preconditions for developing a decentralized energy system: citizens are ready to adopt a more active role as energy citizens in terms of demand response and prosumerism \u2013 irrespective of their attitudes on macro-level attitudes on governmental institutions. Democratization of the energy system could strengthen the legitimacy of energy policy making. Social implications: Citizens\u2019 attitudes indicate that their potential for involvement needs to be strengthened in the spirit of energy democracy: the idea of energy democracy needs to be seen in terms of the demand for increased accountability and democratization of the energy sector that was previously not seen as requiring public involvement and was most often depoliticized and dominated by technocrats. However, strengthening energy democracy through demand response and prosumerism is not without its problems: utilization of these devices requires a relatively large amount of resources which depend on the individuals\u2019 socio-economic position. Thus, energy democracy cannot replace but complement electoral participation as a form of energy policy involvement. Originality/value: The contribution of this study is to fill a part of the research gap linking to ongoing energy transitions. As a socio-technical transition can take place only if citizens support and participate in it, we need to better understand citizens\u2019 attitudes on energy consumption and production and energy policy involvement. Citizens\u2019 attitudes on energy production and consumption are becoming more and more critical for managing the energy sector as a result of that the share of wind power and solar power is increasing in the energy system. In a decentralized energy system, citizens have to be prepared to change their modes of operation.

The marginal abatement cost (MAC) of HPs is highly sensitive to the level of heat demand and technology assumptions. Care must be taken when interpreting the results from models with a high degree of aggregation. For similar dwellings, heat demand typically becomes lower for demographic groups that have higher levels of deprivation. For similar dwellings and demographics, households using natural gas typically have double the end-use heat demands of households with electric storage heaters. Therefore, if access to heating with similar costs to that of natural gas-fired heating is gained, the direct rebound effect suggests that the heat demands of households heated with electric storage heaters could double, particularly for households that have relatively high proportions of energy expenditure. Heating technology and building efficiency support mechanisms need to simultaneously address the wider goal of decarbonisation while reducing fuel poverty, and to incorporate measures of demand diversity into future assessment of heat policy that recognises how this rebound may oppose decarbonisation efforts but enable improvements in comfort, welfare and health standards. \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd", "2020"]

Making energy retrofit decisions through life cycle thinking for Canadian residences; Abstract: Improving the energy performance of buildings has been a much-discussed topic over the past few decades. With the current focus on climate change mitigation, emissions reduction has also come to the forefront of this discussion. Retrofitting is an option to improve the energy and emissions performance of buildings. However, in the residential building stock, retrofit planning for existing buildings faces many complexities due to variations in climatic conditions and macro-environment as well as the presence of multiple stakeholder groups. Thus, in identifying solutions, it is necessary to take a holistic perspective that covers these different dimensions. In this paper, commonly used building energy retrofits were evaluated through a life cycle thinking approach. The performance of various retrofit options applicable for single family detached housing were evaluated using the HOT2000 energy simulation software package under the varying climatic conditions and energy supply scenarios across Canada. The retrofits were evaluated in terms of the additional investment, energy use and cost reduction achieved over the life cycle, and life cycle emissions reduction. The findings indicate that the provincial energy mix and the heating system of the house (i.e. electric or natural gas) play a major role in determining the effectiveness of a retrofit, and this \u201ceffectiveness\u201d changes at different stakeholder levels.

An approach often suggested to improve both the environmental and economic performance of the energy system is demand-side management. However, there has been little research into how households perceive load shifting in space heating.

The results indicated that indoor temperatures at home were generally experienced as being low, especially in the morning. Control over heating was regarded as insufficient. No statistically significant difference in thermal sensation and satisfaction between days with and without load shifts was identified. However, after the trial, significantly fewer participants than before were willing to accept greater temperature variations to save energy.

Energy flexibility indicators (e.g., off-peak surplus renewable shifted ratio and off-peak grid shifted ratio) were introduced, developed, and implemented in an interactive buildings-vehicles energy sharing network for the energy flexibility assessment. Several energy-related conflicts, such as energy congestion contradiction and energy-related economic and environmental conflicts, were presented and discussed together with effective solutions provided to decision-makers for optimal design and robust operation. To reach a trade-off between energy-related conflicts, multi-objective optimisation was conducted, and implemented with an advanced multi-objective optimisation algorithm (called Pareto archive NSGA-II). The research results show that the formulated interactive buildings-vehicles energy sharing network demonstrates greater robustness and competitiveness than the conventional isolated system in terms of cost, emissions, and energy flexibility.

In the traditional power grid, energy consumers remain oblivious to their power consumption patterns, resulting in wasted energy as well as money. This issue is severely pronounced in the developing countries where there is a huge gap between demand and supply, resulting in frequent power outages and load-shedding. For electrical energy savings, the smart grid employs demand side management (DSM), which refers to adaptation in consumer's demand for energy through various approaches such as financial incentives and awareness. The DSM in future smart grid must exploit automated energy management systems (EMS) built upon the state-of-the-art technologies such as the internet of things (IoT) and cloud and/or fog computing. In this paper, we present the architecture framework, design, and implementation of an IoT and cloud computing-based EMS, which generates load profile of consumer to be accessed remotely by utility company or by the consumer. The consumers' load profiles enable utility companies to regulate and disseminate their incentives and incite the consumers to adapt their energy consumption. Our designed EMS is implemented on a Project Circuit Board (PCB) to be easily installed at the consumer premises where it performs the following tasks: (a) monitors energy consumption of electrical appliances by means of our designed current and voltage sensors, (b) uploads sensed data to Google Firebase cloud over many-to-many IoT communication protocol Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) where consumer's load profile is generated, which can be accessed via a web portal.

What are the achievable primary energy savings? This paper tries to answer these questions, for the Italian residential sector, by providing coupled energetical and economic evaluations of the electrification pathways. To this end, this paper extends MOIRAE, a bottom-up modelling approach previously proposed by the authors. First, the input data have been upgraded by coupling, using ad-hoc statistical methods, different datasets provided by the Italian Institute of Statistics. Second, to estimate households\u2019 time-variation, a socio-demographic model has been developed, validated, and implemented. Third, an economic model of fixed and variable costs for electrical and thermal appliances has been implemented. Subsequently, the modelling approach has been calibrated against detailed consumption data for the different Italian regions and validated against historical data. Finally, MOIRAE has been employed to unveil the electrification pathways with and without household budget constraints, aiming at replacing natural gas, LPG, diesel, and fuel oil energy carriers with electrical energy. For the different scenarios investigated, the changes in primary energy consumptions and the variation of variable and fixed costs have been included to consider both the energetic and the economic point of view. \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd", "2021"]

This high level of tourist activity has a substantial impact on the energy and water demand. Previous research into smart energy systems on islands has demonstrated that there is significant potential for hotels to partake in energy demand shifting. However, the total potential of such shifting is influenced by variables such as air temperature and the level of occupancy of the hotels. The objective of this work is to quantify the sensitivity of these parameters and their impact on the overall effectiveness of demand shifting within hotels. The assessment contained within this paper utilises Mixed Integer Linear Programming to determine the dispatch of supply and demand on a case study hotel in the Canary Islands. The results show that highest reduction of fossil fuels is reached in a fully electrified hotel energy system. The potential is assumed as independent from weather and guests\u2019 behaviour. If only PV is used, demand shifting in only one hotel leads to a relative change of the degree of self-sufficiency of 1.6\u20131.8% but the results visualise a saturation effect for an already high share of renewable energies. \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd", "2020"]

The fulfillment of advanced functionalities in the smart grid firmly relies on the underlying information and communication infrastructure, and the efficient handling of a massive amount of data generated from various sources, e.g., smart meters, phasor measurement units, and various forms of sensors. In this paper, a comprehensive survey of over 200 recent publications is conducted to review the state-of-the-art practices and proposals of machine learning techniques and discuss the trend in a wide range of smart grid application domains. This study demonstrates the increasing interest and rapid expansion in the use of machine learning techniques to successfully address the technical challenges of the smart grid from various aspects. It is also revealed that some issues still remain open and worth further research efforts, such as the high-performance data processing and analysis for intelligent decision-making in large-scale complex multi-energy systems, lightweight machine learning-based solutions, and so forth. Moreover, the future perspectives of utilizing advanced computing and communication technologies, e.g., edge computing, ubiquitous internet of things and 5G wireless networks, in the smart grid are also highlighted.

In power grids, energy hub operators need to optimally schedule the consumption, conversion, and storage of available resources based on their own utility functions. In sufficiently large networks, scheduling an individual hub can affect the utility of the other energy hubs. In this paper, the interaction between energy hubs is modeled as a congestion game. Each energy hub operator (player) participates in a dynamic energy pricing market and tries to maximize his/her own payoff when satisfying energy demand. We propose a distributed algorithm based on a congestion game, which guarantees the existence of a Nash equilibrium. Furthermore, two different types of signaling are developed (price-based, load-based) and simulation results compared. Simulation results show that with the implementation of either setup the peak-to-average ratio between electricity networks and natural gas networks diminishes. An analysis of the results shows that either setup can dominate the other one with regard to generation costs, convergence rate, price level, and stability.

The application of the MultiScale Integrated Analysis of Societal and Ecosystem Metabolism (MuSIASEM) approach facilitates the study of the factors that determined the impressive transformation of China's residential energy metabolism since 2000. The findings revealed that the year 2009 was a turning point, when the household hours of urban areas exceeded those of rural regions. Before 2009, the residential energy metabolic rate remained relatively stable, the domination of biofuels delayed the increase in the energy metabolic rate (EMR). With the rise in the rapid growth of non-basic living energy demand, the EMR of households has rapidly increased after 2009. A complete decomposition analysis of the EMRs showed that the increase in residential metabolism was dragged down by the urbanization effect from rural households. Moreover, in respect to the energy carriers, the urbanization effect accounted for less than 10% of the total changes in the fuel and electricity EMR, which indicates that energy performance, in regard to the lifestyles in both urban and rural households, will bring about new challenges to China's energy-saving and energy structure refining policies. \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd", "2021"]

The approach is based on an in-house developed hygro-thermal model of an RDC, in which the conditions in each of the three main calculation domains, representing the internal air, heat exchanger and interior, are estimated at a temporal scale of seconds. The interior air temperature, heat extraction rate and run-off condensate were validated towards experimental data with good conformity. Moreover, for demand response purposes, in this article, we provide examples of how the model can be used to evaluate the temporal flexibility in heat extraction demand of RDCs. In a hypothetical supermarket with 11 RDCs exposed to various thermal loads and customer interactions, it is estimated that the heat extraction demand could be reduced to 0 for up to 83\u2215127 s during opening/non-opening hours respectively. With a strategic pre-cooling, the latter time could be extended to 322 s. For the case of a demand response signal requesting the supermarket to absorb excess energy, all RDCs would be able to run at full power for up to 17\u221529 s, and approximately half of them for additional 20 s during opening hours. These findings are based on a total of 44 five-minutes-ahead simulations of possible scenarios for the 11 RDCs, all calculated by the presented model in approximately 10 s.

In this work investigate how introduction of rural unelectrified households to basic electricity temporally stimulates increasing power demands. We use survey-gathered data to show that once households get access to basic electricity, they begin to realise its socio-economic benefits and start to desire more luxurious appliances, especially through social pressure and neighbourhood influence. These desires are realised temporally with activities that lead to increasing households' incomes, leading to increasing loads, and thus to the modifications of the originally installed small SHS, to meet those increasing load demands. Eventually, cumulative increasing loads within a given community could lead to extensions of the grid to that area, as total power demands now justify such investments. Basic SHS therefore potentially act as grid-electrification stimulators, leading to eventual grid electrification of a given community; as an electrification policy, developing communities should consider seeding unelectrified areas with SHS to stimulate power demands for eventual grid electrification. \u00a9 2020 International Energy Initiative", "2020"]

This study narrowed the R&D down to its energy technological level (i.e., energy-saving R&D). In addition, energy-saving R&D can be differentiated according to the players and their purposes, and the existing literature has basically neglected the temporal and spatial characteristics of energy demand.

The empirical evidence based on China's provincial dataset over the period 2000\u20132016 implies that energy-saving R&D has not played a positive role in influencing energy demand.

The DR pilot projects in Europe, North America, and Australia showed that some consumers respond, few consumers marginally respond while some consumers do not respond at all to the DR programs. DR program basically uses pricing schemes, namely, flat price, time-of-use price, inclined block rate price, real-time price, and threshold based real-time price. The problem with these pricing schemes is that consumers (specifically those who have low-income) have to pay electricity bill which is not feasible for them. So, they suffer from energy poverty, that is, they are not able to purchase even the minimum amount of energy which suffices their requirements.

Parking position owners may share their positions with cars when they are not used. However, for electric vehicles (EVs), matching the cars and parking positions is not only an issue of time fitting and renting price but also of how the cars in the shared car parks may participate in the power market as per the behaviour of typical EVs.

Using hourly data from the Texas ERCOT market between January 2015 and February 2019, we empirically show that ORDC prices are significantly negatively affected by wind generation. We find that, if wind generation is relatively low, a 1% increase in wind generation decreases the ORDC price by around 0.15\u20130.1%. This fact may preclude the ORDC from providing long-term price signals and price stability to generators. Moreover, we also find that if wind generation is greater than 9000 MW, the ORDC price is expected to be zero, which may further disincentive to increase generation capacity \u2013especially dispatchable capacity that may be needed as a backup if the wind is not blowing. \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd", "2021"]

However, weak power grids are predominant in these emerging economies. Prior to integrating new PV plants into weak grids, the impacts of such plants on steady-state voltages of the grid should be studied comprehensively, and accurate energy analysis undertaken as part of the economic assessment of the plants. This study proposes a novel framework that uses distinct generation profiles for integration analysis of large-scale PV plants into weak grids. A probable maximum generation (PMG) profile based on clear-sky radiation is suggested for voltage evaluation while an average generation (AG) profile based on average radiation is used for energy analysis. The case study examined large-scale PV plant integration into one of the regional power systems in Mongolia. Load flow analysis was carried out every hour for a full year on a simplified 15-bus case network for 5, 10, 15 and 20 MW PV plant integration scenarios. Application of the PMG profile provided a more robust evaluation of the PV plants\u2019 impact on the voltage profile of a weak grid and resulted in between 1032 and 16,011 possible voltage violations in the integration scenarios, while the AG profile resulted in 75 to 11,059 violations. Conversely, the AG profile outperformed the PMG profile for energy analysis, and total annual generations of PV plants were 7.4 to 29.7 GWh for the case study. The PMG profile overestimated the total annual PV generations by about 51%. The results show the proposed framework could help to improve the assessment of PV plant integration into weak grids by providing robust voltage and accurate energy estimations. \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd", "2021"]

In recent years, technical and socio-economic studies, as well as hands-on experience, have concluded that the integration and participation of consumer are crucial for smart energy systems.

This paper aims to investigate the impact of the confined measures due to COVID-19 outbreak on energy demand of a building mix in a district. Three levels of confinement for occupant schedules are proposed based on a new district design in Sweden. The Urban Modeling Interface tool is applied to simulate the energy performance of the building mix. The boundary conditions and input parameters are set up according to the Swedish building standards and statistics. The district is at early-design stage, which includes a mix of building functions, i.e. residential buildings, offices, schools and retail shops. By comparing with the base case (normal life without confinement measures), the average delivered electricity demand of the entire district increases in a range of 14.3% to 18.7% under the three confinement scenarios. However, the mean system energy demands (sum of heating, cooling, and domestic hot water) decreases in a range of 7.1% to 12.0%. These two variation nearly cancel each other out, leaving the total energy demand almost unaffected. The result also shows that the delivered electricity demands in all cases have a relatively smooth variation across a year, while the system energy demands follow the principle trends for all the cases, which have peak demands in winter and much lower demands in transit seasons and summer.

Early prediction of the energy use for DHW is required for many advanced applications such as smart control, demand-side management, and optimal operation of electric or heat storage. However, predicting energy use of the solar-assisted water heating system is more challenging than typical DHW systems, as it is strongly affected by two stochastic phenomena, demand pattern and solar radiation. Given the increasing use of solar-assisted water heating systems, this paper aims to evaluate the potential to predict energy use in such systems using a novel machine learning approach. In this novel model, a Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) neural network is enhanced by (1) implementing the attention mechanism, a recent development in deep learning inspired by human vision to pay selective attention to the input data, and (2) decomposition of input data into sub-layers. The performance of simple LSTM neural network, Attention-based LSTM neural network (ALSTM) and Attention-based LSTM using decomposed data (ALSTM-D) are compared to a Feed-Forward neural network as a baseline model. Results show that LSTM, ALSTM and ALSTM-D models have a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 25%, 28% and 41% lower than Feed-Forward model, respectively.

A novel non-cooperative Stackelberg game is introduced that incorporates the profitability of the supply-side and helps in solving problems related to overgeneration and photovoltaic curtailment. The non-cooperative game is intended to find the optimal dynamic prices that would leverage distributed storage through the demand-side to stabilize the power grid operation. Ten cases are studied with five photovoltaic plant sizes and two battery designs. A novel quantitative analysis of high levels of solar penetration as a percentage of the total electricity demand is introduced to evaluate the technical feasibility of the studied cases. To evaluate the economic viability of the proposed smart grid system, four metrics were used: the levelized cost of energy, the levelized cost of storage, the payback period, and the net present value. Two out of ten studied cases were concluded to be the most promising cases, one with a solar photovoltaic plant size of 200 MW and the other with 300 MW. The case with 300 MW solar plant is preferred as it paves the way for more solar energy deployment with a solar penetration percentage up to 67.78%. This case had a payback period of 10.72 years and a net present value of $51.44 M for the solar plant and a payback period of 12.06 years and a net present value of $40.75 M for the demand-side. \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd", "2021"]

Therefore, liberalized electricity markets use prices that set explicit monetary incentives to disclose the relevant private information about the market participants\u2019 assets. In this way, information asymmetries may be reduced. Given the different challenges of an integration of renewables, we argue that the associated new forms of volatile power profiles require new forms of power-trading products. In particular, based on recent advances in technical power measurement and billing, individual and market participant-specific power profiles may be superior to the current trading of average volumes. Against this background, we first outline various evolutionary adjustments of existing power-trading products and their underlying product parameters including (1) strengthening local pricing, (2) finer temporal granularity, (3) smaller minimum volume, and (4) shorter gate-closure time. Second, we open up a new perspective in form of a more disruptive shift towards power-profile trade, where market participants define their trading product using the actual power profile as a new product parameter. \u00a9 2020 The Authors", "2020"]

According to the energy hub design and operation, which allows using different energy carriers, it has turned into a critical topic. This paper develops a two-stage stochastic model for energy hub planning and operation. The uncertainties of the problem have arisen from the electric, heating, and cooling load demand forecasts, besides the intermittent output of the solar photovoltaic (PV) system. The scenarios of the uncertain parameters are generated using the Monte-Carlo simulation (MCS), and the backward scenario reduction technique is used to alleviate the number of generated scenarios. Furthermore, this paper investigates the effectiveness of demand response programs (DRPs). The presented model includes two stages, where at the first stage, the optimal energy hub design is carried out utilizing the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. In this respect, the capacity of the candidate assets has been considered continuous, enabling the planning entity to precisely design the energy hub. The problem of the optimal energy hub operation is introduced at the second stage of the model formulated as mixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP).

The path toward achieving those deep decarbonization targets can take various shapes but will surely include a portfolio of economy-wide low-carbon energy technologies/options. The growth of the intermittent renewable power sources in the grid mix has helped reduce the carbon footprint of the electric power sector. Under the need for decarbonizing the electric power sector, we simulated a low-carbon power system. We investigated the role of hydrogen for future electric power systems under current cost projections. The model optimizes the power generation mix economically for a given carbon constraint. The generation mix consists of intermittent renewable power sources (solar and wind) and dispatchable gas turbine and combined cycle units fueled by natural gas with carbon capture and sequestration, as well as hydrogen. We created several scenarios with battery storage options, pumped hydro, hydrogen storage, and demand-side response (DSR). The results show that energy storage replaces power generation, and pumped hydro entirely replaces battery storage under given conditions. The availability of pumped hydro storage and demand-side response reduced the total cost as well as the combination of solar photovoltaic and pumped hydro storage. Demand-side response reduces relatively costly dispatchable power generation, reduces annual power generation, halves the shadow carbon price, and is a viable alternative to energy storage. The carbon constrain defines the generation mix and initializes the integration of hydrogen (H2). Although the model rates power to gas with hydrogen as not economically viable in this power system under the given conditions and assumptions, hydrogen is important for hard-to-abate sectors and enables sector coupling in a real energy system. This study discusses the potential for hydrogen beyond this model approach and shows the differences between cost optimization models and real-world feasibility. \u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2021 Schulthoff, Rudnick, Bose and Gen\u00e7er.", "2021"]

Although the demand patterns are related to the occupancy profiles of buildings supplied by district energy systems, occupant behavior in current UBEM approaches does not usually consider diversity in occupancy profiles among buildings of the same use-type. In this work, a novel method to create context-specific, data-driven commercial building occupancy profiles was used to generate diverse and non-diverse urban building occupant presence models (UBOP). Diverse UBOP randomly assigned occupancy profiles to buildings. Non-diverse UBOP assigned the data-driven mean or median profile to all buildings. ASHRAE standard profiles and occupant densities served as a baseline for comparison. The impact of diverse vs. non-diverse UBOP was assessed by comparing UBEM simulations for district energy efficiency benchmarking, renewable energy integration potential, and district energy system design, using a case study in Singapore. The results demonstrate that, because of the relationship between occupant presence and building systems operation, occupancy profiles are highly sensitive parameters for district energy demand predictions. For the case study, the energy demand estimation is significantly influenced by the shape of occupancy profiles. In particular, the choice of UBOP influences the cooling demand to the degree that district cooling system design decisions might be impacted. Therefore, it is advisable to use diverse UBOP and to run probabilistic UBEM simulations for district energy system design. \u00a9 2020 The Authors", "2020"]

In Singapore, where around 24 to 60% of electricity demand in buildings could be attributed to heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) purposes, air-conditioned buildings represent a significant flexibility resource which could be used to provide DSF and help tackle these challenges. This study aims to investigate the DSF potential of Singapore's building stock and to explore how this potential could be realized through demand-side bidding. To this end, a building energy modeling tool with explicit modeling of the relationship between occupant comfort and HVAC load with model predictive control, CoBMo, is used. CoBMo allows optimal load scheduling to be expressed as a linear programming problem: minimizing overall electricity cost while maintaining occupant comfort. A price-based market clearing model is developed to evaluate demand-side bidding implementation, for which a case study on Singapore's Downtown Core district is developed. Three scenarios with possible future utility-scale photovoltaic (PV) penetration in Singapore's electricity system are explored, alongside a sensitivity analysis and a comparison between centralized dispatch and demand-side bidding with price-quantity pairs and linear curves. Results of the analysis show that DSF potential varies between building types, depending on cooling load and occupancy schedule. When extreme price fluctuations happen in future Singapore electricity market with 10 GWp PV penetration, demand-side bidding could aid consumers to utilize their DSF potential by encouraging more effective energy use and in turn, reducing their total electricity cost. \u00a9 2021 The Authors", "2021"]

The home energy management system (HEMS) is used to manage the consumption and production of energy in smart homes. However, the technology of HEMS architecture can be used for the detection and classification of power quality disturbances. This paper presents low-voltage metering hardware that uses an ARM Cortex M4 and real-time operating system to detect and classify power quality disturbances. In the context of HEMS, the proposed metering infrastructure can be used as a smart meter, which provides the service of power quality monitoring. For this type of application, there is a need to ensure that the development of this device has an acceptable cost, which is one of the reasons for the choice of an ARM microprocessor. However, managing a wide range of operations (data acquisition, data preprocessing, disturbance detection and classification, energy consumption, and data exchange) is a complex task and, consequently, requires the optimization of the embedded software. To overcome this difficulty, the use of a real-time operating system provided by Texas Instruments (called TI-RTOS) is proposed with the objective of managing operations at the hardware level. Thus, a methodology with low computational cost has been defined and embedded. The proposed approach uses a preprocessing stage to extract some features that are used as inputs to detect and classify disturbances. In this way, it was possible to evaluate and demonstrate the performance of the embedded algorithm when applied to synthetic and real power quality signals. Consequently, it is noted that the results are significant in the analysis of power quality in a smart grid scenario, as the smart meter offers low cost and high accuracy in both detecting (an accuracy rate above 90%) and classifying (an average accuracy rate above 94%) disturbances. \u00a9 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd", "2021"]

Also, the batteries are used in a way that they are charged at low power consumption and it will be as a generating unit during the peak-load time, therefore, the objective function is minimizing the power system loss and the related cost. Since the proposed model is nonlinear and has some complexity, the particle swarm algorithm (PSO) is used. To achieve the minimum losses, the best candidate buses are selected based on the proposed sensitivity analysis to manage the connected buildings.

We highlight the capacity of a prosumer to produce energy and minimize the dependency on the providers in the overall proposed energy management. The latter will be able to maximize his satisfaction by trading energy, first, with other prosumers with a suitable price, and by interacting with the providers, if any remaining energy needed, in a distributed way.

GEP ensures that the quantity of electricity generated matches the electricity demand throughout the planning horizon. This kind of planning is of importance because most production and service delivery is dependent on availability of electricity. Over the years, the traditional GEP approaches have evolved to produce more realistic models and new solution algorithms. For example, with the agitation for green environment, the inclusion of renewable energy plants and energy storage in the traditional GEP model is gradually gaining attention. In this regards, a handful of research has been conducted to identify the optimal expansion plans based on various energy-related perspectives. The appraisal and classification of studies under these topics are necessary to provide insights for further works in GEP studies. This article therefore presents a comprehensive up-to-date review of GEP studies. Result from the survey shows that the integration of demand side management, energy storage systems (ESSs), and short-term operational characteristics of power plants in GEP models can significantly improve flexibility of power system networks and cause a change in energy production and the optimal capacity mix.

This problem is particularly severe in military forward operating base (FOB) microgrids, in which the load profile is dominated by environmental control units (ECUs) that operate under thermostatic control. Leveraging the intrinsic energy storage capabilities associated with large loads such as these ECUs and coordinating their operations across neighboring facilities provides an opportunity to reduce peak demand while maintaining system performance.

The model estimates that evening appliance peak demand can be reduced by 38% when the appliances are replaced by the highest energy efficiency label available on market. We find that changing light bulbs to LED would have the same peak reduction as switching cooking or wet appliances to off-peak periods throughout the year. We also show that the evening appliance peak demand could reduce in 2035 by 24% thanks to the improvement of the energy performance of the stock. Cooking appliances, the least favourable appliances to be involved in demand response, is expected to be the highest contributors to the evening peak in 2035.

However, compared with other detection methods, both prediction and detection accuracy need improvement. To overcome this limitation, this work proposes a residential electrical load anomaly detection framework (RELAD) that includes a hybrid one-step-ahead load predictor (OSA-LP) and a rule-engine-based load anomaly detector (RE-AD). Considering that the diversity and randomness of residential electricity usage may render prediction difficult, the OSA-LP cascades an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model and artificial neural networks (ANN) to achieve high precision in linear and nonlinear regression. Meanwhile, through employing the Bayesian information criterion (BIC), the OSA-LP efficiently reduces the influence of the over- or underfitting problem in real-time prediction and improves the prediction accuracy. To remedy the deficiency of overreliance on prediction outcomes in regression-model-based anomaly detection methods, the RE-AD integrates a support vector machine (SVM), the k-nearest neighbors (kNN) method and the cross-entropy loss function to develop an independent detection process to analyze the correctness of data. This method was applied to detect the load of the off-grid solar power plant in Ngurudoto, a rural area in Tanzania with 44 households and nearly 150 residents. The results of the practical application demonstrate that the proposed predictor and anomaly detector exhibit better predictive and detective accuracy than that achieved in previous work, which demonstrates the practicality of the proposed method. \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd", "2020"]

An artificial neural network (ANN) is trained online with building energy data and represented using an explicit set of linear and nonlinear equations. An optimization problem for price-based demand response (DR) is then formulated using the explicit ANN model and repeatedly solved, producing data on optimal HVAC load schedules for various profiles of electricity prices and building environments. Another ANN is then trained online to predict directly the optimal load schedules, which is referred to as meta-prediction (MP). By replacing the DR optimization problem with the MP-enabled ANN, optimal retail electricity pricing can be achieved using a single-level decision-making structure. Consequently, the pricing optimization problem becomes simplified, enabling easier implementation and increased scalability for HVAC systems in a large distribution grid. In case studies, the proposed single-level pricing strategy is verified to successfully reflect the game-theoretic relations between the DSO and building operators, such that they effectively achieve their own objectives via the operational flexibility of the HVAC systems, while ensuring grid voltage stability and occupants\u2019 thermal comfort. \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd", "2020"]

Demand response (DR), the matching of demand to available electricity supply, is a relatively new activity, important for systems that rely on distributed renewable generation. Price-based DR is spreading among residential and small business customers, along with direct control of distributed and aggregated small loads, mostly thermal. In both types of DR, information and communication technology plays a part. This paper contributes to the debates on implementing electricity system transition and on adoption of smart technologies. Through analysis of a large-scale demonstration of highly-distributed smart thermal storage in three European countries, using mixed methods, it supports the claim that DR can usefully be seen as an outcome of interactions between technologies, activities and service expectations. Adopting a broad scope of enquiry to take in customer experiences of DR and the contributions from a range of actors, the paper shows how it was possible to achieve useful levels of aggregated DR in some circumstances. The quality and quantity of DR were influenced by customer experiences of taking part in the demonstration, which in turn were affected by three types of communication: connectivity, control and care. Outcomes also depended on contributions from a range of actors, especially the 'middle actors' who had some direct contact with both customers and programme leaders. Mainstream theory of DR has concentrated on deploying technologies, controls and price signals. The paper demonstrates how, in practice, effectiveness relates to social and organisational as well as technical and economic features of energy systems. It concludes with some implications for design and implementation of DR programmes, and for smart energy policy in general. \u00a9 2020", "2020"]

However, if an advanced control system is not implemented in the islanded MG, problems of power quality may arise. One of these problems is the voltage unbalance. Increasing the number of single-phase roof-mounted PV plants and the number of electric vehicle charging stations in recent times may negatively affect voltage unbalance. One of the methods used to mitigate this problem is the demand-side management (DSM). Here, a solution method based on DSM is presented for the voltage unbalance problem that may occur in an islanded MG. Thermostatically controlled loads, which are often used for DSM, are preferred as controllable loads. A new and novel control algorithm based on voltage sensitivity have been developed. Effects of TCLs on different buses and phases are determined with voltage sensitivity matrix including neutral components. The proposed control algorithm reduces successfully both the voltage unbalance factor and the number of controlled TCLs.

Thus the decarbonisation of heat is a major challenge. Electrification is one possible approach to decarbonisation; however, huge increases in the electrical grid's generation and transmission capacity would be needed to meet the peaks in space heat demand during cold winter weather. Thermal energy storage (TES) may have a role to play in alleviating this problem, by shifting heat demand by hours or longer periods, enabling peaks to be shaved. This work considers the utility of two varieties of thermal energy storage for this application. Adsorption thermal storage (ATS) is a technology offering long term storage at a high energy density, but is a costly and relatively immature option. By contrast, storage of sensible heat in hot water tanks is already widespread, although it has relatively short storage duration and lower density. Here, we simulate the deployment of these technologies in a small residential neighbourhood, in tandem with demand-side management (DSM), to attempt the reduction of peaks in demand. With no storage or DSM, electrification causes peaks to increase by a factor of 2.36. Results so far suggest that both TES technologies have potential to reduce peaks, with a 14% decrease achievable by either 5 m3 of hot water storage, or 0.25 m3 of ATS, in each dwelling. However, it is thought unlikely that adsorption storage is attractive for a purely peak shaving application, given its cost and complexity. \u00a9 2020", "2020"]

This requires the accurate predictions of long-run energy demand and its short-run dynamic mechanism. To this end, we extend the conventional partial adjustment model into the framework of quantile regression and label it as quantile partial adjustment (QPA). The QPA model is able to investigate heterogeneous effects of drivers on energy demand, as well as to capture its whole conditional distribution. We conduct an empirical study on China's energy demand using annual data from 1990 to 2017. The empirical results show that there exists obvious heterogeneous effects, for instance, the inverse-U shaped adjustment speed. Moreover, we design three different scenarios to produce conditional density forecasts of energy demand for the next 12 years. We notice that bimodal curves or even multimodal curves emerge under three different scenarios. These findings imply that there are several possible intervals for long-run energy demand, which leaves enough space to formulate rational and sustainable energy policies in China.

Residential consumers could offer a substantial new source of demand-side flexibility. However, while there is considerable evidence that at least some residential users engage with at least some forms of demand response, there is also considerable variation in user engagement. Better understanding this variation could help to predict demand response potential, and to engage and protect consumers participating in demand response.

The use of Demand Response (DR) measures has emerged as a promising option to tackle these challenges. However, to the best of the authors\u2019 knowledge, the assessment of the theoretical DR potential has not yet been fully addressed in the available literature. This paper presents a first attempt to establish the theoretical load flexibility potential for the Brazilian power sector and includes two central issues: (1) a sectoral assessment across the residential, commercial and industrial sectors and (2) a regional analysis by broadly splitting up the Brazilian power system into four main subsystems. Our findings reveal that the overall maximum hourly theoretical DR potential in Brazil is expected to double, increasing from 12.8 GW in 2017 to almost 25.6 GW by 2050. Although the majority of the demand-side response potential seems to lie in the industrial sector, a lower but still substantial potential for the residential and commercial sectors has been also identified. The evidence from this study supports the hypothesis that the commercial sector will have a key role in offering the most valuable load flexibility potential (i.e. when the power system mostly needs). The high expected increase in the overall electricity DR potential for the residential sector is driven mainly by the increase in both the number of households and the number of appliances per house. However, large amounts of flexible loads in the residential sector might not be necessarily available during on-peak times. Findings of this research may be of great assistance for future analyses to identify, for example, the extent to which DR can cost-effectively compete with other supply-side options. \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd", "2020"]

The ice-storage district cooling system is believed as an effective approach to provide flexibility for hydropower utilization. However, the existing ice-storage operation strategies in demand-side management cause that the ice storage cannot be adjusted in real-time to match the surplus hydropower, which brings difficulties for large-scale hydropower utilization.

Two operation strategies were developed for the integration to achieve power supply-side management of ice-storage district cooling system. One is the new ice-storage power-linked operation strategy, which was proposed to determine the ice storing/ melting capacity in the power dispatch.

In this study, a new electric vehicle aggregator framework is proposed and four different electric vehicle charging scenarios have been modelled to analyse the impact of electric vehicles on the considered industrial microgrid. The remarkable point of this aggregator is reducing the computational time in the presence of a high penetration level of EVs. The EV charging scenarios include; no electric vehicle, uncoordinated electric vehicle charging, unidirectional and bi-directional vehicle to the grid. Diverse types of renewable energy sources such as wind turbines, solar PV panels, and geothermal units are considered, and an energy scheduling model is implemented. Uncertainties of renewable energy sources and electric vehicles behaviour (arrival time, departure time, and travelled distance) are modelled with their probability distribution function from related historical data. Also, for demand-side management, the Time of Use (TOU) strategy is implemented and three cost levels are defined, which contain off-peak, mid-peak, on-peak, and their cost levels. Results show that the suggested vehicle to grid model is effectively reduced the operation cost and maximize renewable energy share. Eventually, a sensitivity analysis is executed, and the result illustrates that a model with an increase in the penetration level of electric vehicles from (100 to 2000) in the industrial microgrid have better effectiveness in relative operation cost in electric vehicle smart charging schemes. It means relative operation cost, which is related to the unidirectional and bi-directional decrease from 0.996 to 0.95 and 0.988 to 0.831, respectively. \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd", "2020"]

However, demand-side management strategies are broadening to incorporate new motivational cues based on pro-social impulses to reduce negative environmental impact and contribute meaningfully to local communities. This evolving relationship between residential customers and utilities is explored to better understand the potential for load malleability achieved through non-economic incentive structures and rate design.

Different solutions are proposed, such as demand side management and energy storage systems. Nevertheless, costs and environmental impacts of some technologies (e.g. batteries) are high. This paper proposes two system designs: Home Energy Storage (HES) and Community Energy Storage (CES). Besides electricity storage, heat storage is used in the two system designs to supply domestic hot water and space heating. Furthermore, the trade-offs between the different storage mediums in relation to costs are analyzed. To achieve that, different methodologies are used to size the electricity and heat storage mediums for HES and CES. Next, a multi-objective mixed integer linear programming model is developed to optimize the operation costs and CO2-emissions for each system design. After that, the model is tested on a residential community situated in Cernier (Switzerland). The results demonstrate that CES performs better than HES on economic and environmental performance due to economies of scale and the optimally sized storage capacity of the battery in CES. Currently, none of the proposed system designs is economically feasible. However, the sensitivity analysis shows that a profitable system design can be obtained for both HES and CES, when the electricity storage (i.e. battery storage) size is reduced and the heat storage (i.e. water storage tank) size is increased. \u00a9 2019 The Authors", "2019"]

This paper presents a spatial-temporal growth model for estimating the adoption of new end-use electric technologies encouraged by energy-efficiency policies. The proposed method consists of three modules: temporal, spatial and grouping. The temporal module calculates by districts or census tracts of a city, the percentage of homes in which residents are prospective buyers of a new end-use electric technology. Then, the spatial module adjusts the calculations made by the temporal module, considering the spatial interactions among the inhabitants of the districts. Finally, the grouping module discovers the low-voltage transformer where the prospective buyers are connected. The results of the proposed model are a spatial database with information related to the percentage of homes in which residents are prospective buyers of a new end-use electric technology, as well as the number of prospective buyers connected to each low-voltage transformer. The results can visualize through thematic maps to identify the districts where the new technology will have faster adoption. The proposed method was employed to estimate the adoption of induction heating cookers in a medium-sized Ecuadorian city. The Ecuadorian government has developed a program of economic subsidies to encourage its population to use this electrical appliance.

While there are numerous system designs and model formulations for minimizing electric bills under dynamic prices the use of these systems has the potential to cause an increase in emissions from electricity generation. The increase in emissions is linked to the difference in fuel mix of marginal generators throughout the day as well as inefficiencies associated with energy storage.

Optimizing only for energy cost resulted in an annual increase of CO2 emissions in all but two regions ranging from 70 to 2200 kg per household.

Internal heat gains from residents and their use of appliances can cover the heating demand to a certain extent. The magnitude of internal heat gains that cover demand are often modelled in a simplified way and thus can be associated with a large uncertainty. Hourly measurements of household electricity use in over 1000 apartments over a year, serves as a foundation for this study. These measurements show a large variation between households with regard to the annual electricity-use. Furthermore, each measurement series representing the unique behaviour in an apartment, shows a variation in household electricity use over time. Through Monte Carlo simulations that use the measurements as stochastic input, this study shows that heating energy demand can vary by up to 50% due to the different habits of residents in a building. This study also shows that the detail at which internal heat gains are modelled is not negligible regarding relative impact on energy and power demands for low-energy buildings.

More economical flexibility options such as demand response and sector coupling might reduce the market size for storage facilities. This paper assesses the economic performance of community electricity storage systems by taking competitive flexibility options into account. For this purpose, an actor-related, scenario-based optimization framework is applied. The results are in line with the literature and show that community storage systems are economically more efficient than household storage systems. Relative storage capacity reductions of community storage systems over household storage systems are possible, as the demand and generation profiles are balanced out among end users. On average, storage capacity reductions of 9% per household are possible in the base scenario, resulting in lower specific investments. The simultaneous application of demand-side flexibility options such as sector coupling and demand response enable a further capacity reduction of the community storage size by up to 23%. At the same time, the competition between flexibility options leads to smaller benefits regarding the community storage flexibility potential, which reduces the market viability for these applications. In the worst case, the cannibalization effects reach up to 38% between the flexibility measures. The losses of the flexibility benefits outweigh the savings of the capacity reduction whereby sector coupling constitutes a far greater influencing factor than demand response.

In most extant studies, DSM in microgrid only consider directly controllable devices for load modification. The load triggered by non-controllable devices with sub-decision-makers are regarded as unchangeable load and generally not considered in DSM. A critical reason for unchangeable load is that the sub-decision makers in these microgrids may not sense and react to external dynamic electricity prices. However, these non-changeable loads in some microgrids contribute significantly to the overall power consumption of the system. Thus, a new demand side management scheme is required for these special microgrids so that the load triggered by these sub-decision makers can also response to external dynamic electricity prices. Based on a case study of a university campus, this study proposes a micro-market module to facilitate the participative behaviours of sub-decision makers in a microgrid with extra financial incentives.

In this paper, a multi-level optimization model, which incorporates energy demand scheduler (DS), energy storage (ES) and solar photovoltaic (PV) panels amongst households, was developed so as to lower the peak-to-average ratio (PAR) of energy demand and reduce electricity bills. This model consists of three levels: (1) household consumption optimization (solo opt) using convex programming, (2) grid consumption optimization (base opt) via a game-theoretic framework, and (3) ES/PV allocation optimization using genetic algorithm (GA opt). This framework searches for the optimal allocation of ES/PV in a heterogeneous residential population subdivided into consumer groups by household sizes and income levels. A case study was performed with model parameters determined by referencing state-averaged electricity bills and electricity usage data from Texas, US. The results showed that GA opt can achieve bills savings of ~11% and a PAR reduction from 1.53 to 1.30 by allocating a non-trivial optimal combination of ES/PVs to the households. Another GA opt approach was adopted by minimizing PAR and found that PAR can be effectively reduced from 1.53 to 1.00 with bills savings of ~4%. Most significantly, it was observed that the optimal allocation differs from the free market equilibrium due to positive externalities and synergies when combining DSM together with ES/PVs. \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd", "2020"]

At present, dispatchable loads in power systems are often operated to run late at night when electricity demand is lowest. However, they might also be managed to facilitate increasing levels of variable renewable generation. A key challenge in estimating this potential, however, is a lack of data showing how dispatchable loads behave at an aggregated level in large systems. This paper helps to fill this gap using a case study of residential hot water systems in the Australian National Electricity Market (NEM). Drawing on detailed interval meter data from the Smart Grid Smart City trial, the potential benefit of optimized control of these systems for possible future high renewable penetrations in the NEM is quantified. Optimized dispatch within the PLEXOS\u00ae for Power Systems software environment demonstrates the potential to decrease power system operating costs as well as reducing conventional generator cycling requirements, reducing peak demand and improving renewables utilization in high renewables scenarios. \u00a9 2019", "2019"]

The microgrid composites a rooftop Photovoltaic (PV) system, a Battery Energy Storage System (BESS), an ice-Thermal Energy Storage System (ice-TESS), and loads. The loads are divided into two sets based on their ability to participate in demand response: i) Plugged Loads (PL) such as lights, and ii) Cooling Loads (CL) such as air-conditioners. The microgrid is islanded and loads must be supplied with local generation resources. Therefore, the BESS is deployed to offset the PV output's variability, and the absence of PV power supply at night time. However, relying only on the BESS incurs high stress and shortens the BESS's lifetime. Hence, we propose an optimal sizing strategy of the microgrid constituents, where the BESS coordinates with the ice-TESS to maintain the balance between generation and load in the microgrid. Nevertheless, the dispatch commands cannot swing freely between the two ESSs because of the difference in the type of energy delivery. Specifically, the BESS stores electric energy and can supply both PL and CL. On the other hand, the TESS can only supply the CL. Hence, the BESS-TESS coordination is also aided by a customer-friendly shifting and curtailment mechanism of CL. The design incorporates the effect of weather uncertainty on the PV output. Weather variations are imitated using Recurrent Neural Networks trained on 19-years of contiguous hourly weather data. After optimizing the sizes of the microgrid constituents, the optimal sizes are used in a detailed dynamic model of the system for a real-time simulation on the OPAL-RT platform. The validation results demonstrate the successful coordinated operation of the microgrid constituents which are cost-effective in sizing. \u00a9 1969-2012 IEEE.", "2020"]

A key challenge of such transitions is integrating and absorbing increased shares of non-dispatchable renewable energy sources, without jeopardizing the security and the reliability of the electricity system. To this end, key solutions include the introduction of demand-side management. However, so far, demand-side management modeling at the building sector has been proven challenging, as existing models are not flexible enough to incorporate a wide set of modeling features and guiding principles, while including all important aspects of end-use. This paper presents a new dynamic high-resolution demand-side management model which brings together all the key features and guiding principles of demand-side management modeling. The novelty of the model lies mainly in its modularity, as the main modeling framework is decomposed into individual modules, hierarchically dependent on components embodying standards and design rules, allowing for multiple configurations and computational efficiency. To demonstrate its applicability the model was used to explore benefits of demand-flexibility for consumers in the residential sector in Greece. Simulation results showed that the flexibility to increase self-consumption can be brought to the Greek electricity sector without a need for significant changes in the current market design, and for consumers to sacrifice thermal comfort and energy services. \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd", "2020"]

While several simulation studies have shown these assumptions to be true, much less is known about how real-life DSM actions affect the heat consumption profiles of buildings. This study analysed real-life consumption data from 109 DH customers over a period of four years.

In the literature, there is a lack of consensus and standardisation in terms of approaches and indicators for quantifying energy flexibility.

Also, the supplier takes advantage of this scheme, by controlling the aggregate network consumption peak through solving a simplified optimization problem, which needs less information about customers\u2019 consumption. The customers\u2019 privacy is preserved in this scheme, because no individual behaviour, in the forthcoming scheduling time horizon, can be extracted from the data sent to the supplier. Besides, in one sense it is a fair solution because the less customer's consumption peak is, the more relative financial benefit he gets.

The use of fossil fuels to supply the required energy is causing global environmental and health issues and is impacting on all life forms on the planet. Given increasing energy consumption, anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions are consequentially increasing. Therefore, it is necessary to replace fossil fuels with renewable energies, biofuels and eco materials and related technologies and to try and find a way to develop sustainable zero emission solutions for all areas including constructions, transport and water resources. A critical and evolutionary way of thinking about the energy (and other resources) demand, management and supply is necessary because there are clear concerns about irreversible impacts to the world and a scarcity of the resources as well. Energy supplies should be mostly or entirely through renewable resources and highly efficient technologies put in place to achieve solution such as nearly Zero Energy Buildings (nZEB). At the same time, all the energy and resource use processes should be optimised in order to maximise the benefits, reduce the costs and promote stakeholders (consumers, companies or governments) network, toward a circular economy. This could be the way to supply the demand without increasing the scarcity of the resources and to simultaneously achieve environmental benefits. Therefore, it should be possible to improve productivity with the same amount of resources, by e.g. maximising the potential of smart grids and heuristically develop solutions with stakeholders. The concept of Demand Side Management (DSM) emerged after the energy crisis and it employs solutions such as reducing the daily peak load. At the same time, creating an educational grid is important to change the established paradigms, in order to promote critical thinking about the wasted resources and thinking holistically about overall consumption. This paradigm shift is changing the market, making it more competitive and reducing inefficiency by promoting the efficient use of resources including the deployment of energy storage during the periods of low consumption in daily peak shift. All these issues present a new way of thinking in the path towards sustainability, maximising the circular economy and reducing environmental impacts, making connections and using the Internet of Things to provide more information to all stakeholders. All these changes in social behaviour are related to the rational use of resources and make it easier to improve the existing infrastructures instead of building new ones. This paper analyses the state of the art at the European level in the production and use of renewable resources. A survey and analysis of the incentives to consumers and the policies to encourage the circular economy, and parallel analysis of benefits and drawbacks, was made. It is intended to identify the main forms of intervention and improvement, culminating in a reflection on how they should be applied to improve the expected results and make them more efficient and sustainable. This is intended to be an evolutionary framework of this concept, from the first stage of use of energy to its final utilisation. By approaching the task in a heuristic fashion, it is hoped to make the environment healthier, and it is envisaged that this concept will evolve from a linear to a life cycle approach. \u00a9 2019 International Solar Energy Society", "2020"]

One possible solution, smart charging, relies on the flexibility within each charging process and controls the charging process to optimize different objectives. Effective smart charging requires forecasts of energy requirements and parking duration at the charging station for each individual charging process. We use data from travel logs to create quantile forecasts of parking duration and energy requirements, approximated by upcoming trip distance. For this task, we apply quantile regression, multi-layer perceptrons with tilted loss function, and multivariate conditional kernel density estimators. The out-of-sample evaluation shows that the use of local information from the vehicle's travel data improves the forecasting accuracy by 13.7% for parking duration and 0.56% for trip distance compared to the data generated at the charging stations. In addition, the analysis of a case study shows that using probabilistic forecasts can control the interruption of charging processes more efficiently compared to point forecasts. Probabilistic forecasting leads up to 7.0% less interruptions, which can cause a restriction in drivers' mobility demand. The results show that charging station operators benefit from leveraging the driving patterns of electric vehicles.

In order to fully deploy a demand side management approach, synergies between interconnected energy systems have to be systematically implemented. By taking this standpoint, this study proposes a new approach to explore the potential of multi-energy integrated energy systems. This approach is constituted by two main steps, which are (1) the performance simulation of selected energy infrastructures and (2) the estimation of related techno-economic performance indicators. Step (1) expands the work presented in previous literature, by including a novel co-simulation feature. In step (2), the levelized cost of energy and location-dependent emission factors are used as key performance indicators. In this paper, the presented approach is demonstrated by implementing two demand side management options for heat peak demand shaving.

The proposed strategies lead to a decrease of up to 70% of primary energy consumption, depending on the indoor comfort requirements.

The district heating scenario is found to be the most techno-economical convenient.

Consumers or agents with flexible consumption profiles are recruited by an aggregator who manages the DR program. The aggregator calls on a subset of its pool of recruited agents to reduce their electricity use during DR events. Agents are paid for reducing their energy consumption from contractually established baselines. Baselines are counter-factual consumption estimates of the energy an agent would have consumed if they were not participating in the DR program. Baselines are used to determine payments to agents. This creates an incentive for agents to inflate their baselines in order to increase the payments they receive. There are several newsworthy cases of agents gaming their baseline for economic benefit. We propose a novel self-reported baseline mechanism (SRBM) where each agent reports its baseline and marginal utility. These reports are strategic and need not be truthful. Based on the reported information, the aggregator selects or calls on agents with a certain probability to meet the load reduction target. Called agents are paid for observed reductions from their self-reported baselines. Agents who are not called face penalties for consumption shortfalls below their baselines. Under SRBM, we show that truthful reporting of baseline consumption and marginal utility is a dominant strategy. Thus, SRBM eliminates the incentive for agents to inflate baselines. SRBM is assured to meet the load reduction target. Finally, we show that SRBM is almost optimal in the metric of average cost of DR provision faced by the aggregator. \u00a9 2010-2012 IEEE.", "2020"]

Simulations considering the marina electric consumption (340 boat sockets, a service building equipped with a sauna and a wastewater pumping station, and the harbour master's office equipped with a heat pump), PV production (60kWp), and the BESS (237 kWh capacity) based on a public real dataset are carried out on a one year time series with a 1 h resolution. Simulations indicate that the proposed approach allows 90% exploitation of the production of the PV plant. Furthermore, results are compared to a na\u00efve control approach. The MPC based energy scheduling improves the self-supply by 1.6% compared to the na\u00efve control. Optimization of the business economy using the MPC approach, instead, yields to 8.2% savings in the yearly energy cost with respect to the na\u00efve approach. \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd", "2020"]

The integration of intermittent renewable energy resources such as photovoltaic (PV) systems has led to a large variation in energy production and increased supply uncertainty in power systems. In this context, demand-side management (DSM) schemes can be used to motivate prosumers to refine their energy behaviours by offering them various incentives.

Promising solutions for minimizing grid injection are the combination of photovoltaic generation with electricity energy storage and load management, the latter commonly known as Demand Side Management. These strategies together with incentives for self-consumption or energy independence from the network will allow facilitating the integration of the always-increasing generation of renewable energy.

Thus, the present research attempted to gain an insight into the factors that drive residential electricity consumers, particularly those with low income, towards or away from demand side management and distributed energy resources. The results of a consumer survey of 207 Japanese households revealed that there is a clear correlation between low-household income and the willingness of the respondents to reduce their energy expenditures. In contrast, the fear of the perceived additional cost required to implement these technologies, and the belief that consumers have inadequate information or support from the utility company, prevents them from adopting new technologies. Further, the results of a comparative analysis indicate that the reputation of the utility company is higher among smart grid users than traditional electricity consumers.

A new three-stage regional-NILM method is proposed to deduce the states of different types of loads in a region by disaggregating its substation demand. Three types of loads are considered in this study: (i) traditional loads; (ii) distributed generation such as photovoltaics (PVs); and (iii) flexible loads like electric vehicles (EVs). The proposed method firstly forecasts the traditional load using the long-term historical data and employing spectral analysis to boost the signal-to-noise ratio. Secondly, the PV capacity is deduced by performing peak coincidence analysis between negative residuals and local solar irradiance data. Finally, a novel limited activation matching pursuit method is proposed to estimate the states of the EVs, including the total EV load and number of EVs. The method is assessed on real data collected from 800 substations, 10 PVs and 50 EVs in the UK. Results show the proposed method for estimating the number of EVs outperforms the approaches based on sparse coding, orthogonal matching pursuit and non-negative matching pursuit by 16.5%, 10.2% and 10.0%, respectively. The proposed Regional-NILM solution provides a cost-effective way for distribution network operators to understand the network's state.

As such, it can improve the efficiency of demand side management, which is required to accommodate the future large number of distributed energy resources connections. \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd", "2020"]

This paper introduces a novel and simplified algorithm for the implementation of a power demand controller. The presented algorithm does not require a model of the electrical load since it is based on a geometrical approach for the estimation of the disconnection time of the controllable load and only requires the nominal power values and the load factors of both the total (full) load and the noncontrollable (base) load as parameters. The power demand control method presented is verified with a computational simulation, and precise control of the demand limit is achieved under random variations of the base and full loads. The proposed control algorithm is simpler than commercial methods and achieves a competitive performance. Simulation results show a better performance by calculating the disconnection times based on load parameters specified as mean values between the average and nominal powers of the full and base loads. Some considerations to tune-up the load factor parameters are also discussed. The presented control method has been successfully implemented on industrial controllers in two steelmaking facilities in Mexico, having an electric arc furnace as controllable load in both cases.

The proposed MPC deals with space-heating demand with extended flexibility. It exploits thermal inertia, inherently present in the building and its heating system, to optimally plan space-heating load in anticipation of weather conditions and energy cost variations. MPC is based on a reliable Reduced-Order Model (ROM). Heating circuit and internal mass are carefully modelled within the ROM structure since these elements can be used for short-term heat storage and therefore play an important role in demand-side management. As for the model parameters identification, training data is restricted to non-intrusive, easily accessible measurements available at the substation level. The model identification approach and control strategy are applied to a well-insulated radiator-heated case-study building simulator developed in Modelica.

The model represents the customer's load pattern as an image and takes into account the load variation and uncertainty by using exponential intuitionistic fuzzy entropy. The advantage is that the proposed method can handle the uncertain nature of customer's load, by adding a hesitation index to the membership and non-membership functions. A multi-level representation of the load patterns is then provided by creating specific bands for the load pattern amplitudes using intuitionistic fuzzy divergence-based thresholding. The typical load pattern is then determined for each customer. In order to reduce the number of features to represent each load pattern with respect to the time-domain data, the discrete wavelet transform is used to extract some spectral features. To cope with the data representation with fuzzy rules, the fuzzy c-means is implemented as the clustering algorithm. The proposed approach also identifies the time periods associated to different load pattern levels, providing useful hints for demand side management policies. The proposed method has been tested on ninety low voltage distribution grid customers, and its superior effectiveness with respect to the classical k-means algorithm has been represented by showing the better values obtained for a set of clustering validity indicators.

Using a case study with a medium-fidelity electric load model for a standard office building, the performance of the proposed framework is validated by quantifying savings in operating cost, reduction of monthly grid peak loads, and the achieved human occupant comfort. To illustrate the advantage of optimizing temperature setpoints and battery dispatch concurrently, the combined performance is compared with that achieved by standalone DSM (i.e., using only battery dispatch or only temperature setpoints). We found that concurrent optimization can reduce a building's monthly peak demand on the grid by up to 26%. Electricity tariff charges are reduced by 11%, more than is required to offset storage costs, thus providing an overall profit to building operators who use such DSM.

In a leader-follower Stackelberg game, the SES provider first maximizes their revenue by setting a price signal and trading energy with the grid. Then, by following the SES provider's actions, the retailer minimizes social cost for the users, i.e., the sum of the total users' cost when they interact with the SES and the total cost for supplying grid energy to the users. A pricing strategy, which incorporates mechanism design, is proposed to make the system incentive-compatible by rewarding users who disclose true energy usage information. A unique Stackelberg equilibrium is achieved where the SES provider's revenue is maximized and the user-level social cost is minimized, which also rewards the retailer. A case study with realistic energy demand and generation data demonstrates 28-45% peak demand reduction of the NAN, depending on the number of participating users, compared to a system without SES. Simulation results confirm that the retailer can also benefit financially, in addition to the SES provider and the users. \u00a9 2010-2012 IEEE.", "2020"]

On the other hand, with the growth of bidirectional charging/discharging Plug-in Electric vehicles (PEV), the capability of storing electrical energy for load shifting and energy sharing among users may take smart grid to a next level.

Inefficient electrical appliances continue to flood the markets of most SSA countries with just a few of the counties having resolute energy efficiency programs with established energy efficiency standards and labels. This paper examines the barriers to energy efficiency in SSA, with a case study on how Ghana was able to overcome these barriers by using high levels of stakeholder engagement to develop and implement its energy efficiency standards and labels for electrical appliances.

This study proposes a trading aiding tool, which is based on a Nash-type non-cooperative game model between residential and commercial prosumers with guaranteed trading fairness. The model is generalized considering commonly used energy supply technologies and various demand-side management measures. The energy cost for both residential and commercial prosumers can be minimized with fair pricing strategies for both electricity and heating trading.

This leads to an increasing demand for energy storage and demand-flexibility. Electrification of residential heating systems in combination with advanced controls utilizing dynamically the structural thermal mass (STM) of buildings as thermal storage could provide some of the required demand flexibility. In this work, a model predictive control (MPC) algorithm is developed and applied within a simulation framework to control dynamic heating operation as a measure of STM based residential load shifting (LS).

It optimizes heating operations required for LS according to a dynamic primary energy factor signal, while observing transient thermal comfort constraints. The implemented auto-regressive black-box model with explanatory variables predicts thermal conditions within the observed thermal zone with sufficient quality to support MPC. Based on that model, the control algorithm successfully activates STM as a measure of LS according to the given primary energy (PE) oriented utility function.

Applying information and communication technologies to power systems makes it possible to reduce GHG emissions in the residential sector, for example through the development of smart homes. Smart homes are more energy efficient and thus, they may be prone to the rebound effect (RE), (i.e., an increase in demand following the introduction of more efficient technology). Moreover, because the electricity's environmental impacts, cost and demand all vary over time, the potential for RE may also fluctuate. Accounting for these temporal aspects could therefore provide more insights into how and why potential RE may occur in smart homes, especially with regard to households' behaviours. In this study, an agent-based model is used to simulate standard and smart home electricity consumption. Life cycle assessment and environmentally extended input-output tables are used to calculate the households' electricity consumption and RE GHG emissions during the simulations. Results show that, while indirect RE in smart homes is low (about 5% in the simulations), the choice of metric used for smart electricity management is key to maximize the GHG emissions reductions of smart homes. When smart homes perform load shifting based on an economic rather than environmental signal, RE increases by almost five-fold. Moreover, certain periods, such as weekdays or the winter season, lead to more significant RE. Thus, considering factors that decrease RE could enable smart homes to reach their full potential contribution to sustainability. \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd", "2020"]

Although, many ignore the potential, economic and energetic benefits these alternatives could hold for buildings, users and tariffs. In the study carried out a control system of demand management measures is analyzed, based on the use of the buildings' thermal mass as thermal storage (preheating, precooling and night ventilation). This demand management system is analyzed in five existing residential buildings in the so-called reference scenario (construction, user and current prices). Subsequently, comes the analysis of the optimal management strategy choice from the system, when facing changes in the housings' constructive characteristics and electric tariffs. The dynamism of the management system stands out from the results achieved, as well as the dependence of the possible strategy choices on the climate zones.

The proposed 5G concept builds on state of the art by connecting flexible electricity demands such as heat pumps, and electric vehicles to intermittent, renewable and secondary energy sources and storage using artificial intelligence to facilitate optimal control and to maximise revenue and carbon savings. The proposed innovative method is being applied in central London through the development of two independent 5G smart energy schemes. The proposed schemes will incorporate a range of different renewables and secondary energy sources, for example, waste heat from local data centres and the London Underground that will supply a large proportion of the energy demand of the overall district network capacity. Both networks will operate at close to ambient temperature, approximately 15\u201325 \u00b0C as a so-called \u2018ambient loop\u2019 system, with individual heat pumps for each end-user or building connected to the network.

I identify this impact by using the variation in the implementation of decoupling measures over time and across utility companies in the US. Using individual utility-level data between 2007 and 2011 from the US Energy Information Administration on energy efficiency spending and other utility characteristics I find that decoupled utilities spend, on average, about $16 per customer more on energy efficiency than utilities that have not been decoupled. Therefore, given the increasing importance of energy efficiency as an effective way to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases and an ongoing increase in different regulatory environments of electric utilities, it appears that decoupling policies may be effective instruments to promote energy efficiency spending. \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd", "2019"]

We analyse the propensity of islanders to install photovoltaic panels and to change their energy-consumption habits, i.e. to reduce their use of energy or to allow the electricity grid to manage their batteries. This meant interviewing them about their willingness to shift from the role of consumer to that of \u201cprosumer\u201d. The analysis is part of the sociotechnical approach which suggests that decentralised production encourages people to change their attitudes towards energy when they produce it themselves. It is based on interviews (47) and on questionnaires (142) submitted to PV producers who sell their entire production (full sale) or their surplus after self-consumption to Electricit\u00e9 de France (EDF) and who own a storage battery. We find that the interviewees\u2019 representations of the electricity grid and locally used energies were marked by the insular nature of their land.

Our findings indicate that the fact of becoming a PV electricity producer is a response to a common desire for energy autonomy (in relation to fossil fuels, power cuts or electricity bills). This reaching for autonomy is not the same as a desire to break away from the electricity grid. It provides the opportunity to redefine the role of PV producers in tomorrow\u2019s electricity system.

In this context, Demand Side Management (DSM) can be employed to align supply and demand and improve reliability of the system under supply constraints and stretch the capacity limits of the existing grid infrastructure. A game theoretic approach for a DSM model incorporating storage components is suggested in this paper especially for environments with energy supply constraints.

The analysis was performed on one year of smart meter electricity demand data from 656 households in Switzerland. We present a rigorous assessment of sample aggregation and clustering approaches for creating representative electricity demand profiles. We propose a clustering method using five features defining the shape of household electricity demand profiles, which demonstrates significantly improved cluster quality relative to using raw profile data. The cluster analysis of average household electricity demand profiles resulted in three distinct clusters, which challenges the assumption made by Swiss energy norms that one standard pattern fits all homes. Furthermore, cluster analysis of daily demand profiles within the household was performed, resulting in four distinct clusters and demonstrating that daily raw profiles for a household significantly differ from the average profile for that household. Averaging the data suppresses the diversity of the electricity use patterns within the individual household.

This poses a challenge for distribution system operators (DSOs) as their networks are not designed for such load changes. DSOs could use networks more efficiently with demand side management (DSM), where consumers of electricity alter their consumption patterns, shifting (production/consumption) loads in the distribution system. In such a setting, consumers would trade DSM services with the DSOs. However, currently, DSOs follow the \u2018copper plate approach\u2019 which assumes the system should have sufficient capacity to ensure that the desired volumes of electricity can be transported. This seeks to guarantee regulated third party access (rTPA) for all system users. Next to rTPA, based on regulated tasks, DSOs should ensure secure, reliable and efficient systems. In doing so, the DSOs are bound by unbundling requirements, which do not allow them to be involved in any activities other than those related to distribution. Therefore, especially production and supply are not allowed. Still, it seems debatable whether EU law allows DSOs to apply DSM, as it has an impact on both the access conditions to the electricity system, and the production, supply and trade of electricity.

However, existing techno-economic approaches for flexible power systems modelling do not recognise that demand response, where it affects the comfort of the end-user, is heavily influenced by the biases and preferences of consumers. That is, demand response is modelled under the assumption that end-users are always rational and active economic agents. This has consistently resulted in seemingly inexplicable gaps between modelled and observed results for demand response schemes. Behavioural economics, which applies psychological insights into economic modelling, has been proposed to address this problem. This work determines the suitability of behavioural economics as an approach for modelling demand response before reviewing the application of behavioural economics ideas in energy related studies. Then, the effect of different customer biases and preferences on the modelling of demand response is studied, through adaptation of an existing techno-economic demand response model. The results demonstrate that consideration of biases can impact modelling of demand response provision, especially when demand for an energy end-service is high. These findings are of interest to procurers of demand response. Results also demonstrate that appealing to customers pro-social preferences can be an effective way of soliciting demand response.

A more flexible energy demand could contribute to handling the resulting challenges in electricity grid management. The service sector is one of the target groups for utilizing flexible demand, also called demand response (DR). Supermarkets, hotels, and office buildings can be found in regions throughout Germany. This could be an advantage regarding the compensation of grid instability in any region, compared to more locally focused industrial enterprises. First estimations point out considerable unused DR potentials for the service sector. However, currently, there is less knowledge about flexibility options in the service sector than in industry. Moreover, market barriers, such as a missing adequate regulatory framework offering attractive incentives prevent that the potentials are tapped. Therefore, in this paper, we first analyze survey data from 1.000 enterprises of the service sector in Germany to identify subsectors that have a high share of flexible cross-sectoral technologies in electricity consumption. Data indicates that the subsectors trade, restaurants, and hotels as well as office-like buildings are the most promising subsectors of the service sector regarding demand response potential, since they have a high stock in flexible cooling appliances, air conditioning, and ventilation. In a second step, we conducted stakeholder interviews, to find specific barriers, drivers, and possible starting points in each of the identified subsectors. Still unapt or missing regulatory framework conditions, low profitability, and a lack of knowledge regarding flexibility potentials and marketing mechanisms seem to be the main barriers. However, framework conditions promoting demand response measures are improving, e.g., technical standards and latest regulatory revisions.

Flexibility quantification whilst accounting for prosumer heterogeneity is non-trivial. Therefore in this work a novel two-step optimization framework is proposed to quantify the potential of prosumers to absorb surplus renewable electricity through the integration of air source heat pumps and thermal energy storage. The first step is formulated as a multi-period mixed integer linear programming problem to determine the optimal energy system, and the quantity of surplus electricity absorbed.

Results show that the number of active prosumers is affected by the quantity of absorbed electricity, frequency of requests, the price offered by aggregators and how prosumers determine the acceptable value of flexibility provided.

Energy flexible buildings with electric heating, smart demand-side management and efficient thermal energy storage are one of the most promising strategies to deploy low-carbon technologies which can benefit the electricity system by reducing the need of reinforcing existing networks and their ability to use electricity in times of low demand and high supply. Combined with spot price contracts, in which the electricity tariff changes every half-hour depending on supply and demand, they can effectively reduce on-peak demand periods, achieve economic profits for end-users and retailers, and reduce the environmental impact of the electricity grid by operating in periods with lower CO2 emissions rate. To achieve these benefits, it is crucial to develop accurate models for energy flexible buildings as well as control strategies to optimise the complex system operation. This paper proposes a novel flexible energy building concept, based on smart control, high density latent heat storage and smart grids, able to predict the best operational strategy according to the environmental conditions, economic rates and expected occupancy patterns. The smart integration model, carried out in TRNSYS for a Scottish case study, solves a multi-criteria assessment based on future energy demand prediction (learning machine model supported by end-user's predefined occupancy by Internet of Things, present and forecast weather data, and building load monitoring), electricity tariff evolution and building performance. The results show that end-user's electricity bill savings of 20% are obtained and retailer's associated electricity cost is reduced by 25%. In addition, despite an increase in final energy consumption of up to 8%, the environmental impact remains constant due to operation at times with lower CO2 emissions rate in electricity generation.

This paper presents a qualitative, interview-based, comparative study of how homeowners adapt their practices to the changing systems of electricity provision in two countries, Pakistan and Denmark. It reveals that household practices like laundering are flexible, highly contextualised and embedded in the wider socio-material and cultural context. In Denmark, time-shifting of laundering in households with photovoltaics is done voluntarily and closely interwoven with the temporal rhythms of the common dual-income household, as well as the natural cycles of the sun and weather, and is in most cases based on some degree of automation. In Pakistan, blackout schedules dictate time-shifting of most practices. Large family sizes and nuanced clothing make laundering more complex, socially bound and time-consuming; however, joint family systems, provision of house-staff and outsourcing make it more time-flexible and less dependent on automation and electricity-use. Using theories on temporalities of practices in a cross-cultural analysis highlights the significance of local socio-material and cultural context in the performance, bundling and synchronisation of practices. While practice theories prove useful in cross-cultural comparison of temporalities of household practices and demand, further theory development is needed to conceptualise practices as shared or socially differentiated entities in varying cultural contexts. This has implications for demand management policies proposed in smart-grid transitions as well as in the possible cross-cultural transfer of smart technology and demand response strategies. \u00a9 2019, The Author(s).", "2019"]

However, in the emerging renewable power scenario, this technology has received a new interest among the scientists. In this paper, a comprehensive thermodynamic analysis is performed for conventional and modified configurations that enhances the round-trip efficiency appreciably.

This development along with the digitalisation of power distribution grids (smart grids) is setting the scene to a new paradigm: peer-to-peer electricity trading. The design of the features and rules on how to sell or buy electricity locally, however, is in its early stages for microgrids or small communities. Market design research focuses predominantly on established electricity markets and not so much on incentivising local trading. This is partially because concepts of local markets carry distinct features: the diversity and characteristics of distributed generation, the specific rules for local electricity prices, and the role of digitalisation tools to facilitate peer-to-peer trade (e.g. Blockchain). As different local or peer-to-peer energy trading schemes have emerged recently, this paper proposes two market designs centred on the role of electricity storage. That is, we focus on the following questions: What is the value of prosumer batteries in P2P trade?; What market features do battery system configurations need?; and What electricity market design will open the economical potential of end-user batteries? To address these questions, we implement an optimisation model to represent the peer-to-peer interactions in the presence of storage for a small community in London, United Kingdom. We investigate the contribution of batteries located at the customer level versus a central battery shared by the community. Results show that the combined features of trade and flexibility from storage produce savings of up to 31% for the end-users. More than half of the savings comes from cooperation and trading in the community, while the rest is due to battery's flexibility in balancing supply-demand operations. \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Ltd", "2018"]

Some households in the community may own renewable energy sources (RESs) conjoined with energy storage systems (ESSs). Some other residences own ESSs only, while the remaining households are simple energy consumers. We first propose a coalitional cost optimization method in which RESs and ESSs owners exchange energy and share their renewable energy and storage spaces. We show that by participating in the proposed game these households may considerably reduce their costs in comparison to performing individual cost optimization. We further propose another coalitional optimization model in which RESs and ESSs owning households not only share their resources, but also sell energy to simple energy consuming households. We show that through this energy trade the RESs and ESSs owners can further reduce their costs, while the simple energy consumers also gain cost savings. The cost savings obtained by the coalition are distributed among its members according to the Shapley value. Simulation examples show that the proposed coalitional optimization methods may reduce the electricity costs for the RESs and ESSs owning households by 18%, while the sole energy consumers may reduce their costs by 3%. \u00a9 2010-2012 IEEE.", "2019"]

This framework enables us to estimate the saturation (i.e., number of a particular electric appliance per household) and the extent of adoption (total number of a particular electric appliance owned in each province), and to assess the impact of each driver. We focus on six types of appliances: personal computer, air conditioner, microwave oven, refrigerator, washing machine and television, and project their adoption during the 2015\u20132050 period. The projections are conducted for forty-five scenarios that combine five levels of population growth, three levels of per-capita gross domestic product (GDP) and income growth, and three levels of change in household size. We find that, among the six appliances investigated, ownership of personal computers and air conditioning equipment will grow the most, and that the current differences in appliance saturation among provinces and between urban and rural regions will almost disappear by 2050. However, most of the appliances will be owned in urban centers in Eastern China, where the majority of the population will be concentrated. Income growth, combined with urbanization and a reduction in household sizes, increases the total number of appliances, while a reduction in population decreases the total number of appliances.

However, studies that investigate the response obtained from applying these techniques to larger groups of buildings, and how this response affects the aggregated load profile, are needed. To enable such analysis, this paper presents a modelling methodology that enables bottom-up modelling of large groups of residential buildings using data from public building registers, weather measurements, and hourly smart-meter consumption data. The methodology is based on describing district heating consumption using a modified version of the building energy model described in ISO 13790 in combination with a model of the domestic hot water consumption, both of which are calibrated in a Bayesian statistical framework. To evaluate the performance of the methodology, it was used to establish models of 159 single-family houses within a residential neighbourhood located in the city of Aarhus, Denmark. The obtained bottom-up model of the neighbourhood was capable of predicting the aggregated district heating consumption in a previously unseen validation period with high accuracy: CVRMSE of 5.58% and NMBE of \u22121.39%.

Recent trends show that the households are gradually adopting renewables (e.g., photovoltaics) and energy storage (e.g., electric vehicles) in their premises. This research addresses the energy cost optimization problem in the smart homes which are connected together for energy sharing. The contributions of this paper is threefold. First, we propose a near-optimal algorithm, named Energy Cost Optimization via Trade (ECO-Trade), which coordinates P2P energy trading among the smart homes with a Demand Side Management (DSM) system. Our results show that, for real datasets, 99% of the solutions generated by the ECO-Trade algorithm are optimal solutions. Second, P2P energy trading in the microgrid potentially results in an unfair cost distribution among the participating households. We address this unfair cost distribution problem by enforcing Pareto optimality, ensuring that no households will be worse off to improve the cost of others. Finally, we evaluate the impact of renewables and storage penetration rate in the microgrid. Our results show that cost savings do not always increase linearly with an increase in the renewables and storage penetration rate.

Results show that this control strategy can significantly increase the seasonal COP, ranging from 2.90 to 3.51 depending on the building thermal mass.

The objective of NILM is to identify the power consumption of individual appliances and to detect when particular devices are on or off from measuring the power consumption of an entire house. This information allows households to receive customized advice on how to better manage their electrical consumption. In this paper, we present an alternative NILM method that breaks down the aggregated power signal into categories of appliances. The ultimate goal is to use this approach for demand-side management to estimate potential flexibility within the electricity consumption of households. Our method is implemented as an algorithm combining NILM and load profile simulation. This algorithm, based on a Markov model, allocates an activity chain to each inhabitant of the household, deduces from the whole-house power measurement and statistical data the appliance usage, generate the power profile accordingly and finally returns the share of energy consumed by each appliance category over time. To analyze its performance, the algorithm was benchmarked against several state-of-the-art NILM algorithms and tested on three public datasets. The proposed algorithm is unsupervised; hence it does not require any labeled data, which are expensive to acquire. Although better performance is shown for the supervised algorithms, our proposed unsupervised algorithm achieves a similar range of uncertainty while saving on the cost of acquiring labeled data.

Norwegian timber buildings are lightweight and four different insulation levels are considered. Both on-off and modulating air-source heat pumps are analyzed and compared to direct electric heating which is the most common heating system for Norwegian residential buildings. A detailed model for both the heat pump system and the building is implemented, a level of detail not found in previous research on building energy flexibility. The three PRBC investigated have the following objectives: reduce energy costs for heating, reduce annual CO2eq. emissions and reduce energy use for heating during peak hours. This last objective is probably the most strategic in the Norwegian context where cheap electricity is mainly produced by hydropower. The results show that the price-based control does not generate cost savings because lower electricity prices are outweighed by the increase in electricity use for heating. The implemented price-based control would create cost savings in electricity markets with higher daily fluctuations in electricity prices, such as Denmark. For the same reasons, the carbon-based control cannot reduce the yearly CO2eq. emissions due to limited daily fluctuations in the average CO2eq. intensity of the Norwegian electricity mix. On the contrary, the PRBC that reduces the energy use for heating during peak hours turns out to be very efficient, especially for direct electric heating. For air-source heat pumps, the control of the heat pump system is complex and reduces the performance of the three PRBC. Therefore, results suggest that a heat pump system should be modeled with enough detail for a proper assessment of the building energy flexibility. First, by varying temperature set-points there is a clear interaction between the prioritization of domestic hot water and the control of auxiliary heaters which increases energy use significantly. Second, the hysteresis of the heat pump control and the minimum cycle duration prevent the heat pump from stopping immediately after the PRBC requires it.

Whilst some of our data suggests that households broadly accept this, it also suggests that governments could more actively lead and steer demand-side mitigation via adjusting and supplementing a comprehensive list of 20 climate policy measures currently in place in one or more of the case countries. The paper concludes by suggesting areas for more effective policy change and household-level climate change mitigation to feed the next update of climate pledges under the Paris Agreement. \u00a9 2018, Springer Nature B.V.", "2019"]

It analyses the impacts of the active power demand measurement-time resolution on the financial attractiveness of DSHWS. The predominance of a late-evening profile of electricity consumption for showering, coinciding with distribution utilities\u2019 peak demand hours, leads to over 40% avoided active power during peak hours per consumer unit when adopting DSHWS. There is potential to finance DSHWS in popular housing with very favourable conditions for the distribution utility. For discount rates ranging from 0 to 9.5%, payback times ranged between less than four and five years, NPV between $ 2,191 and $ 782, and IRR between 25% and 14%. The measurement of power demand at 15-min intervals, widely adopted by distribution utilities, is not adequate to properly evaluate the financial attractiveness of DSHWS, resulting in pessimistic financial analyses of the return on investment. The low load-factor of electric showerheads used in >90% of Brazilian households, leads to the accounting of only 37% of the real avoided cost of adopting DSHWS when measuring power demand in 15-min intervals. \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd", "2019"]

Within energy grids, Smart Home scenarios can be characterized by a unique combination of appliances and user preferences. To increase their impact, a scenario-specific selection of the best performing DR methods is necessary. As the user faces a multitude of heterogeneous DR methods to choose from, a complex decision problem is present. The primary goal of this study is to develop a decision support framework that can determine the best-performing DR methods. Building on literature analyses, expert workshops and expert interviews, we identify seven requirements, derive solution concepts addressing these requirements, and develop the framework by combining the concepts using a benchmarking process as a template. To demonstrate the framework\u2019s applicability, we conduct a simulation study that uses artificial (simulated) data for seven types of households. Within this study, we employ four DR methods, assume changing appliances over time and cost minimization as primary objective. The study indicates, that by using the framework and thus by identifying and using the best DR method for each scenario, the users can achieve further cost benefits. The application of the framework allows practitioners to increase the efficiency of the DR method selection process and to further enhance DR-related benefits, such as cost minimization, load profile flattening, and peak load reduction.

In this paper, we develop a data mining-driven incentive-based demand response (DM-IDR) scheme to model electricity trading between a VPP and its participants, which induces load curtailment of consumers by offering them incentives and also makes maximum utilization of DERs. As different consumers exhibit different attitudes toward incentives, it is both essential and practical to provide flexible incentive rate strategies (IRSs) for consumers, thus respecting their unique requirements. To this end, our DM-IDR scheme first employs data mining techniques (e.g., clustering and classification) to divide consumers into different categories by their bid-offers. Next, from the perspective of VPP, the proposed scheme is formulated as an optimization problem to minimize VPP operation costs as well as guarantee consumer's interests. The experimental results demonstrate that through offering different IRSs to categorized consumers, the DM-IDR scheme induces more load reductions; this mitigates critical load, further decreases VPP operation costs and improves consumer profits. \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd", "2019"]

In order to maximise these benefits, advanced control methods are required. The model predictive control methodology is a promising candidate for such applications as it is capable of incorporating economic and operational objectives whilst respecting various technical, regulatory and environmental constraints. In order to implement such a control strategy effectively, it is necessary to develop appropriate system models. This paper presents a novel generalised modelling framework for multi-energy systems that is particularly well suited, though not limited to, predictive control applications. The proposed approach is capable of representing energy converter arrangements of arbitrary complexity containing multiple energy vectors, as well as multi-directional energy flow, multi-generation and multi-mode devices, a wide range of controllable producers/consumers, energy storage and flexible loads. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated using a representative case study based on three buildings at the University of Manchester where the developed model is incorporated into a model predictive control scheme. The simulation results show how the controller minimises the cost of purchasing energy whilst satisfying operational constraints, and managing various types of flexible demand. \u00a9 2018", "2019"]

Detailed spatial data on heat demand and supply are generated using combined top-down and bottom-up modelling for 14 member states of the European Union, which constitute 91% of its heat demand in buildings. Spatial analysis is used for zoning of heat supply into individual and collective heating. Continuous cost curves are used to model economically feasible district heating shares within prospective supply districts. Excess heat is appraised and allocated to prospective district heating systems by means of a two-stage network allocation process. Access to renewable energy sources such as geothermal, large-scale solar thermal, as well as sustainable biomass, is analysed. The result is a comprehensive and detailed set of heat supply strategies in a spatially discrete manner. The findings indicate that in the 14 European Union member states, up to 71% of building heat demand in urban areas can be met with district heating. Of this, up to 78% can be covered with excess heat, while the remainder can be covered with low enthalpy renewable energy sources.

They can use and produce energy and also actively manage their energy demand. The energy flexibility quantifies their potential to adjust the energy demand on the basis of external requests. The objective of this paper is to propose a method for buildings energy flexibility labelling at design conditions in the same fashion as the energy performance label. The flexibility quantification is based on the calculation of four flexibility parameters, which contribute to the definition of the Flexibility Performance Indicator. In order to assess the Flexibility Performance Indicator, buildings dynamic simulations are necessary and the boundary conditions (i.e. demand response event, representative day, comfort constraints)to be considered during the evaluation are provided as part of the proposed methodology. The method was applied to different Italian buildings, which differ for geographic location and design specifications and, in particular, the effects of building structure, heating/cooling systems and energy storage systems were compared. Results show that the climatic conditions affect the flexibility performance, while the building feature more relevant is the thermal mass of the building envelope, more than that provided by the distribution system.

The error measurement for the forecast models indicated adequate accuracy and forecast performance (MAPE values under 4%), in general. As the major innovation to the literature, a methodology to provide complementary limit stochastic scenarios (LSS) for each forecast model is presented with two approaches: high consumption (HCA) and low consumption (LCA). Using fractal Brownian motion (fBm) concepts and the successive random addition technique (SRA), random walks (RW) were simulated and then added to both forecast models to generate stochastic scenarios. To start a random walk, three input parameters were determined for each case study: range, length, and Hurst coefficient (H). The most probable stochastic scenarios (PSS) accordingly to the variation coefficient were selected from all the produced scenarios. The PSS with the highest and the lowest average were selected as the limit stochastic scenarios, LSSmin and LSSmax, respectively. Total energy for the following 24\u00a0h was calculated and it showed that the range provided by LSS delivers additional information to electricity dispatchers accordingly to HCA and LCA situations which nor forecast models nor PI can foresee.

Profit allocation due to coalition between H-MGs is an important issue for ensuring the optimal use of installed resources in the whole multiple H-MG system. In addition, considering demand fluctuations, energy production based on renewable resources in the multiple H-MG can be accomplished by demand-side management strategies that try to establish mechanisms to allow for a flatter demand curve. In this regard, demand shifting potential can be tapped through shifting certain amounts of energy demand from some time periods to others with lower expected demand, typically to match price values and to ensure that existing generation will be economically sufficient. It is also possible to obtain the maximum profit with the coalition formation. In essence the impact of the consumption shifting in the multiple H-MG schedule can be considered while conducting both individual and coalition operations.

Traditionally, conventional generation is the only option to provide the required flexibility. However, the provision of the flexibility from the conventional generation such as coal-fired generating units comes at the cost of significantly additional fuel consumption and carbon emissions. Fortunately, with the development of the technologies, energy storage and customer demand response would be able to compete with the conventional generation in providing the flexibility. Give that power systems should deploy the most economic resources for provision of the required operational flexibility, this paper presents a detailed analysis of the economic characteristics of these key flexibility options. The concept of \u201cbalancing cost\u201d is proposed to represent the cost of utilizing the flexible resources to integrate the variable wind power. The key indicators are proposed respectively for the different flexible resources to measure the balancing cost. Moreover, the optimization models are developed to evaluate the indicators to find out the balancing costs when utilizing different flexible resources.

However, it may require 8% of the customer demand to be flexible and available. Moreover, although energy storage is currently relatively expensive, it is likely to prevail over conventional generation by 2025 to 2030, when the capital cost of energy storage is projected to drop to approximately $ 400/kWh or lower. \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Ltd", "2018"]

Shutting down part of operating chillers directly in central air-conditioning systems can meet the urgent power reduction needs of grids. But during the special events of fast DR, how to optimally control the active cold storage considering the indoor environment of buildings and the needs of grids at the same time is rarely addressed. A model predictive control (MPC) approach, with the features of shrunk prediction horizon, self-correction and simple parameter determination of embedded models, is therefore developed to optimize the operation of a central air-conditioning system integrated with cold storage during fast DR events. The chiller power demand and cooling discharging rate of the storage are optimized to maximize the building power reduction and meanwhile to ensure the acceptable indoor environment. Case studies are conducted to test and validate the proposed method. Results show that the proposed MPC approach can effectively handle the optimal controls of cold storage during DR events for required power reduction and acceptable indoor environment. Due to the feedback mechanism of MPC, the control performance is not negatively influenced by the simplified parameter identification of models, which will be convenient for real applications.

This necessitates the development of novel pricing schemes able to allow energy service providers (ESPs) to maximize their aggregated profits from the traditional markets (trading between wholesale/day-ahead and retail markets) and the innovative flexibility markets. In the same time, ESPs have to offer their end users (consumers) competitive (low cost) energy services.

Energy pricing schemes proposed so far, e.g. real-time pricing, interact in an efficient way with wholesale market. But they do not provide strong enough financial incentives to consumers to modify their energy consumption habits towards energy cost curtailment. Thus, they do not interact efficiently with flexibility markets.

The latter is considered crucial for coping with growing variable renewable electricity supply and essential for allocative efficiency in electricity markets. Yet, significant amounts of the potential efficiency gains from time-varying tariffing may be left unrealized, since many residential and commercial retail consumers could actually prefer to stick with the usual default, which is flat tariffing, in order to avoid potential consumption cost increases. We study how increasing variable renewable supply affects individual consumption cost changes from implementing real-time retail pricing among residential consumers, using consumption data from Germany and simulating long-run electricity market equilibria. We find that most customers face comparatively small bill changes at high renewable supply shares. We further analyze how consumer heterogeneity influences the unrealized welfare gains from rejecting real-time pricing. Applying synthetic residential, commercial and industrial demand profiles calibrated to German market data, we find that unrealized welfare gains are 18% to 57% larger, if mostly residential and commercial instead of industrial customers remain flat-priced. The corresponding unrealized welfare gains can more than quadruple to 1.1 bn EUR per year, if renewable supply shares increase. Additionally, targeted rollouts of real-time pricing can entail adverse distributional effects across consumer sectors. Particularly residential consumers can face rate increases, if mainly industrial consumers adopt real-time pricing. \u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.", "2018"]

Using this strategy, buildings manage their own power demands locally only using the aggregated power demand of building cluster as the common reference for their demand controls. This distributed computing allows the optimization of large systems or complex optimization problems to be divided into a few simple optimization tasks, providing enhanced applicability and robustness in practical applications. Case studies are conducted and results show that the proposed game theory-based decentralized control strategy can increase the aggregated peak demand reduction and electricity cost saving more than two times compared with that when the demand management of building cluster is conducted in an uncoordinated manner. Meanwhile, the control performance of proposed decentralized strategy is close to that using a perfect demand management control strategy. \u00a9 2019", "2019"]

One of these challenges is the interaction among different energy hubs\u2019 facilities and various operational parameters on the scheduling of the energy hub systems. This paper deals with the problem of optimal scheduling of smart residential energy hub (SREH) considering the different uncertain parameters. The effect of the market prices, demands and solar radiation uncertainties on the SREH scheduling problem is characterised through a risk-constrained two-stage stochastic programming model. The objective of the proposed scheduling problem is to determine the least-cost 24\u00a0h operation of the facilities that would cover the cooling, thermal and electrical demands. The Monte Carlo simulation method is applied to model the inaccuracies of solar radiation, energy demands, and electricity market prices. Additionally, a proper scenario-reduction algorithm is employed to reduce the number of scenarios and simulation burden. The proposed approach evaluates the impacts of different values of risk aversion parameter and the utility of the demand response program on the optimal solution of the proposed PV integrated SREH scheduling.

As distributed and flexible energy storage as well as demand response (DR) sources, BSSs have great potentials to tackle both high penetration of variable renewable energy (VRE) sources and real-time EV charging. However, these potentials have not been fully explored as existing research mainly uses BSS for the single purpose of battery swapping. To make the full use of BSS, this paper presents a real-time energy management strategy for a BSS based smart community microgrid (SCMG), using VREs to supply EV batteries (EVBs) and conventional residential loads (RLs). A novel Lyapunov optimization framework based on queueing theory is designed to solve the proposed model. It addresses the variability of supply, demand and energy prices without assuming their forecasts or future distributions, and can also ensure the quality of service (QoS). The proposed method can simplify the complex energy scheduling and transform it into a single optimization problem, making it suitable for real-time applications, which require high computational efficiency. Simulation results found that BSS used for the dual purposes can improve the whole system economics and facilitate the utilization of renewable energy compared to isolated operation. It also demonstrates competency of the proposed algorithm compared to other benchmark algorithms. This work provides future SCMG operators insights into different underlying tradeoffs in managing electricity supply and demand cost-effectively with BSSs and VREs. \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd", "2019"]

In this regard, providing end users with detailed information about their consumption patterns enables them to make informed decisions to reduce or adapt their energy consumption. This requires the deployment of interactive feedback technologies such as domestic energy displays, dedicated apps/web portals, or ambient interfaces. Extensive research and numerous pilot projects have examined the effects of these technologies on end-user behavior and identified the importance of an appropriate device design to achieve the desired demand response. However, a clear framework for designing these feedback technologies to ensure the desired behavioral change does not exist. To fill this gap, this paper presents an exhaustive review of existing research on feedback, with a particular focus on interactive devices. This review has identified ten key parameters that should be considered by device designers, including the type and form of the information provided (medium, units, disaggregation level, comparisons, goal setting), the design of the interface and devices themselves, the possible inclusion of penalties and rewards, and privacy concerns. Recommendations are provided for implementing these parameters in such a way that end-user interactions and responses are maximized. These recommendations would make domestic displays more effective in creating the desired household behavioral change to maximize energy conservation. Moreover, critical areas are identified where further research is necessary before a prudent recommendation can be made. \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd", "2019"]

For different environments (energy mix, power plant capabilities, outages, etc), the results highlight that postponing the balancing gate closure time from 1 h to 15 min increases the operational cost of the system.

Under some extreme circumstances, the flexible demand resources (FDRs) may have the potential to dominate and obtain excess benefits, preventing other FDRs from participating in the electricity markets. Therefore, it is of great significance to identify the key FDR market power locations and implement some corresponding regulations. However, the relevant researches in power systems focused on the supply side, rather than the demand side. In this paper, a novel nodal market power analysis method is proposed to evaluate the potential influence of FDRs on electricity markets. Firstly, a multi-state model is established to present the multiple power system operation states including the random failures of system components. Then, the nodal market power assessment model is established under each specific state and new indices are proposed to evaluate the nodal market power of FDRs quantitatively. Furthermore, the key FDR nodes in demand side with stronger power in capturing excess revenue are identified. The 24-bus IEEE Reliability Test System is modified to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method.

In particular, home energy reports (HERs) have been used to induce behavioural change among residential consumers. These HERs typically provide peer comparisons of energy use and information about energy savings opportunities. Despite the growing prevalence of HERs and a shift from postal to electronic delivery of HERs, the experimental evidence base of their effectiveness comes primarily from HERs delivered by post from a single vendor (Opower). Whether that evidence generalises to other programmes and to the electronic delivery of HERs is unclear. This paper reports new evidence for HER effectiveness from a 12-month field experiment with approximately 9,000 households that tested electronic HER programme in a deregulated American residential electricity market. Despite high non-compliance with HER delivery, the programme reduced household electricity consumption by 2.9%, 95% CI [-5.0%, \u22120.76%].

However, the high cost of stand-alone microgrids intended to serve generally poor communities remains a key barrier to their deployment, while design and operation is challenging, given generally low diversity of loads and generators, and often high penetrations of variable renewable generation. Current practices for providing electricity access still often focus on the supply side with an emphasis on ensuring the reliability, affordability and security of electricity supply to meet user demand. This supply focus misses some key opportunities on the demand-side for providing low cost and reliable energy service delivery. In particular, rural communities may place very different relative values on various energy services, while there may be considerable flexibility in terms of when some of these energy services are delivered; due to inherent energy storage in the end-use equipment, or user willingness to shift the energy service itself. This paper presents a novel characterisation framework for energy services based on their relative flexibility and consumer prioritisation. Detailed survey data from 154 households across five microgrid sites in Nepal is used to test this framework, and assess the potential insights that it can provide for microgrid designers and operators seeking to reduce costs and improve reliability when serving poor rural communities.

While numerous studies have been undertaken to investigate the benefits of demand-side flexibility, most have either focused only on the power sector or provided a snapshot for a future year or day. The influence of interactions between sectors in the long-term under energy transition pathways has therefore been under explored. This paper presents a novel modelling approach in a whole energy systems model, UK TIMES, to investigate the benefits of demand-side flexibility from smart appliances and passenger electric vehicles, including the reduction in the costs of moving to a low carbon economy. This analysis shows that demand-side control increases system flexibility, enabling the integration of high levels of low carbon power, such as nuclear and wind, whilst reducing the requirements for storage. By 2050, the peak load is reduced by around 7 GW (9%), and cumulatively about 30.9 billion GBP saved with the help of this demand-side flexibility.

The continuous double auction (CDA) market is viewed as a promising P2P (peer to peer) market mechanism to enable interactions among demand side prosumers and consumers in distribution grids. To achieve optimal operations and maximize profits, prosumers in the electricity market must act as price makers to simultaneously optimize their operations and trading strategies.

Many countries have imposed real-time electricity pricing to efficiently control demand side management.

Within a consumer-centric market framework, peer-to-peer (P2P) approaches have gained substantial interest. P2P markets rely on multibilateral negotiation among all agents to match supply and demand. These markets can yield a complete mapping of exchanges onto the grid; hence, allowing to rethink the sharing of costs related to the use of common infrastructure and services. We propose here to attribute such costs through exogenous network charges in several alternative ways, i.e., uniformly, based on the electrical distance between agents and by zones. This variety covers the main grid physical and regulatory configurations. Since attribution mechanisms are defined in an exogenous manner to affect each P2P trade, they eventually shift the market issue to cover the grid exploitation costs. It can even be used to release the stress on the grid when necessary. The interest of our approach is illustrated on a test case using the IEEE 39 bus test system, underlying the impact of attribution mechanisms on trades and grid usage. \u00a9 1969-2012 IEEE.", "2019"]

The proposed approach is used to activate flexibility at the residential level to resolve any forecasted bottlenecks and power surpluses in the grid. The field test is part of the REnnovates project. The capability to react to grid requests comes from residential loads with some type of energy consumption flexibility associated. In the field test, three types of actors are included: the distribution system operator (DSO), the aggregator, and the residential end users. Two levels of control are distinguished: the end users' level and the district level (grid congestion management). Dual decomposition is used to compute virtual prices that influence the power profile of individual houses to solve grid congestion problems, previously identified by the DSO, in the least intrusive or disturbing way. Results have shown that, even as operational constraints and end users' comfort requirements limit the flexibility, congestions in the grid can be suppressed in most of the tests using the proposed method. This success is however dependent on the amount of energy requested to be changed, the corresponding period of the day, and for how long. \u00a9 1969-2012 IEEE.", "2019"]

Empirical evidence from Germany; Abstract: Motivating consumers to adjust their electricity demand with a volatile electricity supply is an important aspect of the energy sector's transition from fossil to renewable energy sources. (Co-)ownership in renewable energy production facilities turned out to be successful in engaging citizens to finance infrastructures and research indicates that it can also induce behavioural changes in energy consumption.

Our results show a statistically significant effect of (co-)ownership of renewable energy production facilities on the willingness of citizens to adjust their consumption behaviour to match their electricity demand to production levels.

The case of Sweden; Abstract: 100% renewable energy systems require high penetration of variable renewable electricity (VRE) generation. This causes the net load in the system to be more variable and could cause operational problems in local power grids. Demand side management (DSM), such as fuel or energy carrier switching in response to a price signal, can provide flexibility to meet the increased variability. This study investigates the impact of VRE production on electricity prices and their potential to act as an incentive to control district heating power-to-heat (P2H) production in order to shave VRE production peaks. Also, the potential to increase P2H production flexibility with additional heat storages is studied. Electricity prices are simulated by modification of historical electricity market supply curves. A heat storage component is implemented in an existing model for district heat production. The results show that P2H production is significantly increased (up to 98%) when electricity prices are influenced by VRE production. Thermal storages further increase the P2H production by up to 46%. The increased P2H production, however, does not necessarily coincide with the peaks of VRE. Thus, in conclusion, the pricing mechanism on the Nord pool electricity market is insufficient to control P2H production for shaving VRE production peaks. \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd", "2019"]

Demand-side management enables consumers to control their energy profile to reap economic benefits. It also helps energy providers to reduce the peak average ratio (PAR) by leveraging the flexibility of distributed energy resources (DERs) and renewable-energy resources (RESs) to supplement grid power, thereby avoiding the use of expensive peak-power plants. This paper presents an improved game-theoretic DSM framework for a neighbourhood area to provide cost savings for the consumer and reduce the PAR for the neighbourhood. The proposed DSM framework utilizes the flexibility of DERs and RESs to allow energy sharing among neighbours to reduce the demand peaks. A novel real-time price (RTP) retail tariff model has been established based on historical and predicted wholesale prices. A Nash-game-theory-based optimization model is developed for scheduling the building loads and DERs. The optimization model minimizes the energy cost to the consumer while maintaining an optimal comfort level for the consumer and satisfying consumption constraints to reduce peak demand. The proposed DSM framework and optimization model is verified via case studies with real building consumption data for a neighbourhood in Sydney, Australia. Game-theoretical analysis ensures that users do not make profits if they deviate from their assigned consumption pattern. The performance of various algorithms is evaluated and their effects on the peak average ratio (PAR) and energy costs are discussed. The effectiveness of the proposed game-theoretic optimization model is validated and compared with traditional non-game-theoretic models. The results of the proposed algorithm show reductions in the peak average ratio of the community and the cost incurred by the consumers. The PARs of the game-theoretic approach during summer and winter are 1.76 and 1.81 respectively. The cost reduction of the game-theoretic model is 9.17% during summer and 9.68% during winter compared to the non-cooperative approach. The numerical results represent the efficacy of the proposed DSM model in reducing the PAR of the community and the energy cost to the consumer. \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Ltd", "2018"]

In many cases, activities can be performed in several ways, but once planned, the replanning or cancellation can become impracticable. In Antarctic Research Stations and isolated communities, the planning of activities is even more critical due climatic time windows and facility availability. Considering these aspects, this work proposes and analyses a demand-side management method based on the cooperative combination of activity plans. The method does not depend on the installation of load-control devices neither knowledge of the user about electricity or tariffs. Based on options of plans informed by the users, the proposed multi-objective optimization algorithm search for the set of plans that both minimizes the cost of energy production and the discomfort of the whole community. Simulations performed for a wind-solar-diesel microgrid with 100 users in scenarios of lack and excess of renewable resource indicate that the proposed method can contribute to the adjustment of the aggregate demand profile of users served by isolated microgrids. In the simulations, the problem of overgeneration by the renewable sources was solved and 8.6% of fuel savings was achieved by the intervention in only 51% of the users.

We first conducted a one-week experiment in a shallow alluvial aquifer, which is characterized by a slow ambient groundwater flow, to assess its potential for thermal energy storage and recovery. This experiment has shown that up to 90% of the stored thermal energy can be recovered and would therefore suggest that aquifer thermal energy storage could be considered for demand-side management applications. We then conceptualized, developed, and calibrated a deterministic 3D groundwater flow and heat transport numerical model representing our study site, and we simulated 77 different scenarios to further assess this potential. This has allowed us to demonstrate that low-temperature aquifer thermal energy storage (temperature differences of \u22124 K for precooling and 3, 6, and 11 K for preheating) is efficient with energy recovery rates ranging from 78 to 87%, in a single aquifer thermal energy storage cycle. High-temperature aquifer thermal energy storage (temperature differences between 35 and 65 K) presents lower energy recovery rates, from 53 to 71%, with all other parameters remaining equals. Energy recovery rates decrease with increasing storage duration and this decrease is faster for higher temperatures. Retrieving directly useful heat (without upgrading with a groundwater heat pump) using only a single storage and recovery cycle appears to be complicated.

In the industry, energy is often supplied by on-site utility systems with electricity grid connection. Usually, electricity from the grid is assumed to have annually averaged emission factors when greenhouse gas emissions are calculated. However, emissions from electricity production are in fact time-dependent to match continuously varying demand and supply. These time dependent emissions offer the potential to reduce emissions by temporal shifting of electricity demand in demand-side management. Here, we investigate the impact of time-dependent grid mix emissions for low-carbon utility systems. For this purpose, we present a detailed mixed-integer linear programming model for a low-carbon utility system. Subsequently, we compute time-dependent grid emission factors based on the current mix and based on the marginal technologies. These grid emission factors serve as input to determine and economic and environmental trade-off curves. We show that emissions can be reduced by up to 6% at the same costs by considering time-dependent grid mix emissions, instead of annual average grid emissions. Marginal time-dependent emission factors even allow to reduce emissions by up to 60%.

The OGS problem usually minimizes the cost of energy assuming a fixed configuration of power systems. On the other hand, the DFR problem is done assuming a predefined generation of units.

This study is concerned with how thermal energy storage can be integrated into heat pump systems to improve demand flexibility, and ultimately allow the heating system to remain off during peak periods. Heat pumps tend to operate under a limited temperature range, which limits the energy storage density of water as a thermal storage medium. Phase change materials (PCM) can be used as thermal storage, and they benefit from the ability to maintain a high energy density under limited temperature conditions. The challenge is that PCMs have a relatively low thermal conductivity which can limit the rate of charging and discharging of the stored thermal energy. In the current state-of-the-art literature, there is no standard methodology to size PCM thermal energy storage units for heat pump systems. This study presents novel results that compare numerical and analytical predictions of a hybrid PCM-water thermal storage tank, and proposes a reduced analytical methodology for sizing PCM thermal storage tanks for heat pumps used for demand side management.

An intelligent DSM approach not only gives advantages to utilities but also provides indirect benefits to generating companies. This article introduces a combined model of multi-objective dynamic optimal power flow (MODOPF) and a game theory-based DSM technique. In this article, a single utility company and multiple residential energy consumers are considered for the game theory-based DSM technique. Here, the day ahead load shifting DSM technique is implemented with the help of a day-ahead pricing strategy and an energy consumption game. The total generation cost and transmission losses are considered as the main objectives in the proposed MODOPF problem. These two objectives were optimized individually and simultaneously using harmony search (HS) algorithm with different DSM participation levels for the investigation of generation side benefits. The proposed combined model was tested on two different test systems such as IEEE 30 bus and 118 bus.

Therefore, the current paper proposes a novel method for day-ahead optimization of integrated water-heat-electricity systems with the aim of minimizing the fuel cost of the desalination, heat treatment and power production units. The technical limits of the power only units, combined power and water generation units, cogenerators of heat and electricity, heat only units, and the seawater purification process are incorporated in optimization problem. In addition, a real-time demand side management strategy is applied on heat, pure water and power loads to reduce the objective cost function as low as possible by shifting a percentage of each demand from peak periods to mid or off peak hours. Moreover, aggregators of pure electric vehicles participate in bulk energy management by charging electricity during off-peak low-price hours and discharging it over the on-peak high-price periods. To validate the feasibility and cost-effective performance of the water-heat-power hub system, a mixed-integer non-linear program is developed by generalized algebraic mathematical modelling system (GAMS) optimizer and solved by branch-and-reduce optimization navigator (BARON) tool. The ramp down and ramp up limits of the thermal power plants, generation capacity of water/heat/power producers, and the load-generation balance criterion are considered as optimization constraints.

Since the integration of renewable energy sources requires flexibility, we compare V2G with two competing systemic flexibility options provided by highly flexible power plants and resulting from EU high voltage grid expansion, respectively.

Nevertheless, as DG continues to grow, matching supply and demand efficiently becomes increasingly difficult. In the area of microgrids, this becomes a major challenge. The majority of existing research deals solely with preserving the stability of the power grid, while some studies have broadened their focus to include the issue of balancing supply and demand. The aim of this study is to present a solution to the power imbalance problem based on the idea of splitting the energy transaction into small energy fragments (EF), simultaneously generated by the producer and obtained by the consumer with such accuracy that the disturbances are negligible. To this end, a new control scheme is presented, where suppliers and customers take advantage of new technologies (ICT) in order to trade an agreed upon amount of energy with no impact on the power. The effect of the control algorithm on the power grid is evaluated through simulations conducted in a microgrid benchmark network, comparing performance with and without energy transactions.

There are various supply-side measures that utilities have to take to ensure continuous energy supply for building heating and air-conditioning. During peak energy demand, utilities are often forced to use more expensive and less efficient generation, thereby increasing the cost of energy. However, some demand-side management practices behind the consumer meter can help in meeting this challenge. One such measure is the use of thermal storage for heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning applications in commercial buildings. There is a gap of adequate knowledge of an optimal control strategy of cold storage operation in buildings adapting to applicable time of day tariffs to minimize annual energy use and annual energy cost of operation. There is also a need to use commercially available tools to avoid the use of complex mathematical models. This study demonstrates strategic controls with six operating modes for using thermal energy storage to shift peak electricity demand, using the time of day tariffs as a decision variable, and reducing operating costs, while also minimizing the size of the system.

Research suggests that ESS tend to increase grid emissions, but some speculate that retail rate design could lessen its impact. This paper tests that theory. In this analysis, we pair five years of historic data from ISO New England (ISO-NE) and the PJM Interconnection with 15 commercial building load profiles to reveal how different rate designs influence emissions from ESS. We find that demand and energy charges can be configured to lessen the emissions impact of ESS in some markets and reduce net system emissions in others. Minimizing different types of demand charges requires different quantities of ESS dispatch: some can be minimized in hours while others require days. Time-varying energy charges increase dispatch compared to flat charges because the ESS is used for demand charge management and energy arbitrage. Separately, time-varying energy charges reduce emissions per MW h-stored compared to flat charges, all else equal. Unfortunately, a rate design that minimizes emissions in one market might increase emissions if implemented in another.

Renewable energy resources are one possibility to mitigate the dependence of residential buildings on the electrical grid. However, their integration into the existing grid infrastructure must be done carefully to avoid instability, and guarantee availability and security of supply. Demand response, or demand-side management, improves grid stability by increasing demand flexibility, and shifts peak demand towards periods of peak renewable energy generation by providing consumers with economic incentives. This paper reviews the use of reinforcement learning, a machine learning algorithm, for demand response applications in the smart grid. Reinforcement learning has been utilized to control diverse energy systems such as electric vehicles, heating ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems, smart appliances, or batteries. The future of demand response greatly depends on its ability to prevent consumer discomfort and integrate human feedback into the control loop. Reinforcement learning is a potentially model-free algorithm that can adapt to its environment, as well as to human preferences by directly integrating user feedback into its control logic. Our review shows that, although many papers consider human comfort and satisfaction, most of them focus on single-agent systems with demand-independent electricity prices and a stationary environment. However, when electricity prices are modelled as demand-dependent variables, there is a risk of shifting the peak demand rather than shaving it. We identify a need to further explore reinforcement learning to coordinate multi-agent systems that can participate in demand response programs under demand-dependent electricity prices.

At its peak, this amounted to over a 7 GW supply-demand gap and caused the electricity grid to be offline for vast swathes of population for many hours daily. Despite major supply-side investments acute shortages persist and a large percentage of relatively affluent households, estimated in millions, have countered this by investing in self-generation and battery storage technologies (usually lead-acid batteries because of their low cost).

Here we present an interview study with 11 EV manufacturers active in the UK, determining their perceptions on the market potential for demand-side flexibility using EVs. Findings indicate manufacturers view significant potential in this market, but believe time is needed (i.e. in the 2020s) for the EV market to develop before there is enough system/consumer demand for flexibility using EVs. They believe better price signals are needed, and prefer a consumer-led approach (rather than, for example, mandatory smart charging). Most manufacturers recognise they have a role in making flexibility a viable offering, but for it to succeed it needs coordination with other players, notably energy suppliers, aggregators, network operators and consumers. Governments should have a role in encouraging and brokering such partnerships. There was little evidence of concern that network constraints resulting from multiple EVs charging on the same circuit could act as a brake on sales. We identify a risk that EV growth could outpace available infrastructure and flexibility market mechanisms, leading to grid management challenges. \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd", "2019"]

Temporal and spatial decoupling of supply and demand is an important element to be considered for the evolution of built environment, especially when creating sectorial level planning strategies and policies. Energy efficiency measures, on-site generation technologies, demand side management and storage systems are reshaping energy infrastructures and energy market, together with innovative business models. Optimal design and operational choices in buildings are systemic, but buildings are also nodes in infrastructural systems and model-based approaches are generally used to guide decision-making processes, at multiple scale. Built environment could represent a suitable intermediate scale of analysis in Multi-Level Perspective planning, collocated among infrastructures and users. Therefore, the spatial and temporal scalability of modelling techniques is analysed, together with the possibility of accommodating multiple stakeholders\u2019 perspectives in decision-making, thereby finding synergies across multiple sectors of energy demand. For this reason, the paper investigates first the cross-sectorial role of models in the energy sector, because the use of common principles and techniques could stimulate a rapid development of multi-disciplinary research, aimed at sustainable energy transitions.

In a smart home an Automated Home Energy Management System (AHEMS) endowed with adequate algorithms should allow for an integrated optimization of the available energy resources (grid, loads, local generation and storage) in face of time-differentiated tariffs. This paper defines a novel and comprehensive smart home modeling that includes several relevant categories of energy resources as well as a set of practical comfort specifications that the user may freely decide upon. An AHEMS capable of computing compromise solutions by balancing the minimization of total cost (energy and power) and dissatisfaction caused to the users (e.g., by rescheduling load operation) is studied under this novel smart home modeling. Emphasis is given to the study of different power cost scenarios and how they affect the solutions found by the AHEMS. Two types of power cost scenarios are studied: contracted power with known fixed costs and limits on the power requested from the grid, and variable power charges according to the peak power requested from the grid. A detailed analysis of the physical characteristics of the solutions is also provided. Overall, the results show that the variable power charges scenarios surpass the contracted power scenarios in terms of cost and dissatisfaction. Besides incurring in lower power costs, the variable power charges scenarios also obtain lower energy costs. The variable power charges scenarios also provide the users with a greater flexibility over the energy resources, while removing the risk of energy supply interruptions that is present in the contracted power scenarios. In terms of grid management, the results show that the variable power charges scenarios do not present any particular risk of incurring in very high peaks of power requests. In terms of energy policy considerations and given the transition to smart homes and grids, these results suggest that contracted power scenarios may be phased out and safely replaced by variable power charges scenarios with the deployment of AHEMS. Furthermore, the feasibility of deploying the AHEMS under study in a low-cost embedded system is also assessed. The results show that this AHEMS can compute interesting and diverse solutions for practical implementation in less than 90 s. \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd", "2019"]

In recent years, there have been a growing number of publications focusing on the estimation of different categories of DR potentials (e.g. theoretical, technical, economic, and achievable)using different methodologies and assumptions in each research study. The contribution of the present study is twofold. Firstly, a literature review is undertaken focusing specifically on the categorization of the scientific approaches used to estimate the different categories of DR potentials. To the best of authors' knowledge, a general procedure for the estimation of each DR potential category is still missing. Therefore, a novel user-friendly and step-by-step theoretical framework for the determination of the different categories of DR potentials is presented. Findings of this study reveal that literature has extensively focused on the estimation of the technical DR potential followed by the economic, theoretical and achievable potentials respectively. A lack of understanding of the different categories of DR potentials was also identified, which sometimes have been unduly used in the literature. The proposed framework is supported on a small sample of numerical approaches and equations which results in a structured approach to bringing consensus to the DR potential assessment. \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd", "2019"]

Achieving a win-win situation for a grid and buildings with such interactions remains a challenge. Game theory is a powerful tool for using strategic analysis to identify the best interactions between multiple players. Stackelberg game can effectively reflect the core status of grid and the auxiliary position of buildings in this interaction (particularly in demand response programs), but no study used this game to establish such interactions while simultaneously considering the multiple requirements of grid and buildings, particularly for the commercial sector. In this study, therefore, basic and enhanced interaction strategies between a grid and buildings are developed using the Stackelberg game based on their identified Nash equilibria. The grid optimizes the price to maximize its net profit and reduce demand fluctuation, and individual building optimizes the hourly power demand to minimize electricity bill and effects of demand alternation from the baseline. In addition, the effects of building demand baseline uncertainty on the interaction are investigated and the enhanced robust interaction is proposed to deal with such uncertainty. Real site data of buildings on a campus in Hong Kong are used to validate the proposed interaction strategies. The results show that the proposed basic interaction increased net profit by 8% and reduced demand fluctuation by about 40% for the grid, with savings in electricity bills of 2.5\u20138.3% for the buildings.

Apart from power generation, VSI-based energy sources can also perform ancillary services such as demand side management using conservation voltage reduction (CVR). In conventional distribution systems, CVR involves lowering the voltage levels of the system within permissible limits to reduce the amount of power consumed by certain loads. However, in autonomous microgrids, the application of CVR for demand side management has not been fully explored yet. Thus, in this paper, a CVR strategy for a droop-controlled VSI-based distributed generation (DG) operating in an autonomous microgrid is proposed. This strategy employs the deviation in DG output voltage magnitude and frequency, caused by an increase in power demand during peak and overloading conditions, to determine the amount of voltage compensation required to reduce the microgrid bus voltages. In addition, a controller to coordinate between the proposed CVR strategy and load shedding is also developed to operate the DGs during overloading conditions. The proposed strategy is verified with a microgrid test system, and its performance is validated on MATLAB/Simulink software environment. \u00a9 2019 IEEE.", "2019"]

To solve this issue, several methods have been proposed to control the demand side instead of increasing the spinning reserve in the supply. Here we focus on dynamic demand control (DDC), a method in which smart devices can autonomously delay its scheduled operation if the electric frequency is outside a suitable range. While typical control schemes can effectively reduce small and medium size frequency fluctuations, the probability of large demand peaks, and hence large frequency fluctuation, may increase due to the need of recovering pending tasks. Although these events are rare they can potentially trigger a failure of the system and therefore strategies to avoid them need to be addressed. In this work we introduce a method including communication among DDC devices belonging to a given group, such that they can coordinate opposite actions to keep the group demand more stable. We show that, with minimal information exchange, our method reduces the amount of pending tasks by a factor 10 while large frequency fluctuations are significantly reduced or even completely avoided. \u00a9 2019", "2019"]

This is particularly due to the fact that residential energy demand loads are highly dependent on the activity patterns of the household. Therefore, activity models are being increasingly used to underpin high-resolution energy demand models. This paper details the implementation of a new methodology for the analysis of empirical activity data that allows for the identification of characteristic behavioural patterns within them. The identified patterns are then used as the basis for the construction of a high-resolution residential user activity model. The model attempts to capture the statistical characteristics of the empirical data in the form of a stochastic process with memory of variable length. The proposed model is compared to a model based on the predominant first-order Markov chain approach. In addition to the modelling approach, a new metric for assessing the quality of activity sequences simulations is proposed. Given the amount of empirical data contained in any of the individual time-use datasets currently available, it would appear that the performance improvement over the predominant first-order Markov chain approach is modest. However, the validation results show that the proposed approach has the potential for broadening our understanding of the scheduling of activities in people's day-to-day lives and how this relates to the observed variability in both activity and energy consumption patterns. \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd", "2019"]

The uncertain economic value of residential demand response (DR), and the rising customer data privacy concerns, require non-intrusive and economical approaches to harness flexibility. Baselines are essential for evaluating DR activations, however, the frequent use of flexibility makes them less accurate. In this paper, we first propose a baseline estimation method based solely on aggregated behind the meter data, which does not require additional knowledge of the portfolio's parameters. It is suited for frequent DR activations, and relies on a combination of linear interpolation, forward-backward autoregression and load decomposition. The method is then used to evaluate DR activations, in order to construct, and continuously update, a model for the response and the rebound behavior of the loads. A portfolio of 138 real residential customers equipped with electric heaters, and a large number of DR experiments, were used to verify the proposed approach. The response model, fitted with the experimental results, shows a strong dependency of the load reduction potential on time of day and ambient temperature, with a maximum load reduction equal to 1.2 kW per household. Validation results confirm that the fitted model can be used to estimate the response with a good accuracy.

However, current standards discourage low carbon electricity sources through outdated assumptions; predicated upon a traditional electricity network which had higher emissions. Consequently, the implementation of product Energy labelling across Europe is biased against electric space and water heating systems in favour of gas.

Laboratory testing of a market leading electric water tank and an A rated instantaneous gas boiler has demonstrated efficiencies of 87.4% and 72.9% respectively. In spite of this, the labelling directive assigns a C rating to the tank. This is due to a conversion coefficient (CC)within the directive's calculation based on an average electricity generation efficiency of 40% without a similar coefficient for gas.

In response to this, the concept of near Zero Energy Buildings (nZEB) has been developed. These buildings have very low energy demands and integrate renewable energy to supply residual demand. nZEBs aim to increase energy efficiency from a demand-side user perspective. When looking at the entire energy system, there are also energy efficiency gains to be achieved on the supply-side. For example, from a district heating system. If an energy system becomes more efficient on the supply-side, then the question is how much energy needs to be saved on the demand-side, for instance by low energy buildings such as nZEBs. The purpose of this paper is to analyse and understand the implications from building new low energy buildings, i.e. nZEBs, within an energy system that is (a) transitioning to 100% renewable energy and (b) has substantially improved supply-side energy efficiency.

It is now possible for a utility to influence the customer demand profile via demand side management techniques such as real-time pricing and incentives. Energy storage devices play a critical role in this context, and must be optimally utilized. For instance, the peak power demands can be shaved by charging (discharging) the batteries during periods of low (high) demand. This paper considers the problem of optimal battery usage under real-time and non-stationary prices. The problem is formulated as a finite-horizon optimization problem, and solved via an online stochastic algorithm that is provably near-optimal. The proposed approach gives rise to a class of algorithms that utilize the battery state-of-charge to make usage decisions in real-time. The proposed algorithms are simple to implement, provably convergent for a wide class of non-stationary prices, easy to modify for a variety of use cases, and outperform the state-of-the-art techniques, such as those based on the theory of Markov decision processes or Lyapunov optimization. The robustness and flexibility of the proposed algorithms is tested extensively via numerical studies in MATLAB and real time digital simulator (RTDS). \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Ltd", "2018"]

In this study, a random forest (RF) model coupled with ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) named EEMD-RF is presented for forecasting the daily electricity consumption of general enterprises. The candidate data is first decomposed into several intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) by the EEMD. Through fast Fourier transformation, the features in each IMF are extracted in the time-frequency domain, then simulated and predicted by the RF model. Finally, the results of each IMF are integrated into the overall trend of the daily electricity consumption for those enterprises. The proposed method was applied to two enterprises located in the Jiangsu High-Tech Zone, and the period of collected data was from January 1, 2015 to May 3, 2016.

In addition, energy storage unit and demand side management technology are widely utilized in the island microgrids to alleviate the passive impacts introduced by renewable energy resources.

Robust linearization methods with the consideration of three types of uncertainty scenarios and uncertainty budgets are utilized in the first operation stage.

Fuel supply reliability is a constant problem. Renewable energy could reduce reliance on fuel, but cost and operational complexity are barriers to development. This paper describes the power supply system and end uses for the village island, Fenfushi, Maldives. Hybrid microgrid engineering design analysis using HOMER demonstrates the prohibitive cost of wind and solar systems to meet the normal village load profile. The paper explores the novel idea of differentiating the loads by importance, and asking end users to nominate their voluntary demand participation (VDP) by adjusting their activities to reduce loads when requested. The VDP concept was modeled as deferrable load in HOMER and a hybrid renewable energy system optimization provided lower cost power than the diesel-only microgrid with <10% excess renewable generation. The authors worked with end users and the local microgrid operator to develop a VDP operational strategy and signal to customers. The VDP concept includes a simple method for the powerhouse operator to monitor fuel use, calculate fuel use till next delivery and a benchmark for signaling VDP temporary load reduction from the end-users. A trial of the VDP signal to end users was carried out. The results demonstrate a key concept of energy transition: 100% renewable energy cannot reasonably substitute for fossil fuel supply to satisfy the habituated demand developed when fossil fuel was abundant and low cost. However, essential needs can be met with reasonable renewable energy investment if demand is voluntarily adjusted to match supply. \u00a9 2019", "2019"]

Increasing the temporal resolution is crucial for demand side management modelling or for the simulation of load profile changes due to the installation of new technologies such as heat pumps. Increasing the spatial resolution enables regional energy planning and capturing the spatial dynamics of drivers of energy demand. Yet regional and local energy grids are interconnected with national and continental networks, so to capture multi-scale effects, high resolution is required everywhere. A high-resolution bottom-up engineering energy demand simulation model is introduced, which projects energy demands both for a high spatial and high temporal scale and enables spatial explicit simulation of model parameters.

To assist in interpreting the results and facilitate their integration in simplified simulation of BaB systems in smart grids the model parameters of a simplified Resistance-Capacitance model were found by fitting the experimental results. The results show that, for apartments with high thermal mass, thermal insulation is the key driver of BaB system thermal efficiency, with the highly insulated apartment reaching BaB efficiencies of 60\u201380%.

We assessed the implications on strategic planning of future solar development in an emerging solar market, New York State (NYS)in the U.S., by synthesizing information on electrical infrastructure, tax assessment, geographical constraints and measured meteorological data. Considering three solar PV penetration scenarios (4500 MW, 6000 MW, and 9000 MW), we examined the impact of distributed utility-scale solar farms on peak demand reduction and ramping requirements during historical peak events. Our results reiterate that, across NYS, a wealth of low-value land exists to support utility-scale solar PV and that generation from these resources can reduce peak demand by up to 9.6% under the 9000 MW scenario. In addition, peak demand reduction displays locational and temporal dependency. Contingent upon local meteorology, a solar farm can reduce demand during the peak hour by anywhere between 10 and 74% of its rated capacity during summer HEDDs. However, the highest ramping requirements are more likely to occur during winter than summer. Furthermore, because developers cannot predict performance during the annual system peak, current capacity valuation methodologies for solar projects may not be adequate to promote a healthy competitive market for solar. Incorporating a broader spectrum of peak demand conditions into variable resource capacity valuation would improve strategic planning, not only in NYS, but across growing solar markets worldwide. \u00a9 2019 The Authors", "2019"]

As a result, Energy Service Providers can considerably lower the cost of energy they purchase from the wholesale market and create new revenue streams, while offering consumers lower electricity bills and digital services via online software platforms. Price-based Demand Side Management techniques can trigger the desired behavioral changes and generate novel services and business models for the Energy Service Provider's participation in congestion, balancing, and other emerging flexibility markets. The energy pricing schemes proposed so far, do not strongly motivate consumers to modify their electricity consumption habits, as they are unfair and thus unable to effectively trigger behavioral changes and offer flexibility services.

Performance evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed billing scheme affects the consumers\u2019 behavior much more efficiently than the traditional Real Time Pricing mechanism, outperforming the latter in all widely adopted metrics.

Accelerating electrification and maximizing supply-side and demand-side renewable adoption are two recent strategies being considered in China, but few bottom-up modeling studies have evaluated the potential near-term impacts of these strategies across multiple sectors. To fill this research gap, we use a bottom-up national end-use model that integrates energy supply and demand systems and conduct scenario analysis to evaluate even lower CO2 emissions strategies and subsequent pathways for China to go beyond cost-effective efficiency and fuel switching.

As the demand is never correctly predicted, the volume traded through the balancing markets increases, leading to higher overall costs.

However, hybrid energy systems (HES) which combine renewable generation with backup generators and energy storage are becoming cost competitive. Diesel usually provides about 10% of the demand because most renewables are non-dispatchable and thus the complete decarbonisation requires massively oversized renewable generation and storage. By including renewables with different resource profiles and demand side management (DSM), the diesel consumption could be decreased without increasing storage and renewable generation capacities. Here a framework for the design and optimisation of HES using wind, wave and solar generation and DSM is introduced. For the Mediterranean it is shown that wave energy is not competitive but that DSM reduces the emissions and costs by 21 and 8%. In the North Sea, DSM has lower benefits because waves act as an energy store for the wind. Thus, the combination of wave energy converters (WECs) and wind turbines significantly reduces the need for backup generation and energy storage which leads to large reductions in costs (up to 40%) and emissions (up to 60%).

The ability to control the timing and magnitude of the aggregate electricity consumption of buildings is acquiring critical relevance. Buildings play a pivotal role in defining the shape and composition of the final electricity demand, and have an impact on the existing and projected electrical system infrastructure. This paper proposes distributed electrical storage using electrical batteries at the residential level, as an economical and technically feasible way to introduce a degree of responsiveness with the demand of residential buildings without compromising the comfort of users. The objective of the paper is to devise the operative principles governing the relation between the grid operator and a community of low exergy (lowEx) buildings, under the assumption that the grid operator is interested in controlling the form of the aggregate electricity consumption in that community. This paper presents a pricing policy aimed to stimulate a power-aware consumption, and consequently peak-shave the total electricity profile. The introduced pricing scheme separately addresses energy and power, and provides an incentive for buildings to invest in decentralized generation and storage technologies. The paper presents a methodology to determine the optimal amount of decentralized electrical storage and PV necessary to meet the objectives of the grid operator and allowing users to obtain a profit from the dynamic electricity tariff. A model is used to determine the optimal battery and PV investment from the perspective of the user. The analyses show that the introduced electricity tariff triggers an equilibrium, in which users invest between 20% and 25% of the total incurred cost in battery and PV. The PV and the battery input power were found to be mainly related to the objective of reducing the energy cost. On the other hand, the battery capacity and output power were found to be associated with the peak reduction objective. Users invest less than 10% of the total battery investment share in the battery input power. This fact indicates that contrary to a battery usage driven by the price volatility, which is proposed in many models, the battery is mainly used as power-to-energy buffer.

Here, three different storage concepts are compared: (1) a central buffer tank next to the CHP; (2) small storage vessels distributed over the different connected buildings; and (3) the use of the thermal mass of the buildings as storage capacity. Besides the development of the control algorithms based on model predictive control, a simulation model of the network is described to evaluate the performance of the different storage concept during a representative winter week. The results show that the presented control algorithm can significantly influence the heat demand profile of the connected buildings. As a result, active control of the CHP can drastically increase the profit of the CHP. The concept with the distributed buffers gives the best results, whereas the profit for the thermal mass concept is only marginally smaller. Since in this latter case no significant investment costs are needed, the conclusion for this case study is that the use of thermal mass of buildings for demand side management in district heating systems is very promising. \u00a9 2017 Elsevier B.V.", "2018"]

The case of Finland in 2007-2016; Abstract: Purpose: The purpose of this study is to test citizens\u2019 attitudes on political involvement in energy policy-making that has generally seen to be dominated by experts and business interests and been relatively closed to citizen involvement. The study asks whether citizens are willing to participate politically more through political consumerism (i.e., consumption choices) or through representative democracy and if citizens are willing to assign decision-making to the experts representing public administration and business, as stealth democracy asserts. Design/methodology/approach: Methodologically, the study is based on postal surveys conducted in 2007 and 2016 among a random sample representing Finns who were 18-75 years of age. Findings: Political consumerism and stealth democracy were not considered as alternative and detached modes for electoral participation but rather as complementary. However, adherence to stealth democracy was a reaction of people who feel powerlessness in the face of the regime, while the supporters of political consumerism had a higher trust in their ability to influence. Originality/value: The study is the first one which empirically compares citizens\u2019 support for these three modes of involvement, and it generates new knowledge for the scholars and decision-makers when planning citizen role in (energy) policy-making. \u00a9 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.", "2018"]

For any analysis in power systems such as planning and operation, it is essential to confront the stochastic nature of these sources in order to get much more precise results. Since operators need proper strategies and methods to decline negative effects of the stochastic behaviour of renewable power generators, such as total operation cost growth, this paper provides a review of different state-of-the-art approaches from the operator's viewpoint for handling the stochastic behaviour of renewable sources. Hence, in this paper, three different strategies are categorized for stochastic analysis of these sources. The first strategy is mathematical modelling including stochastic dependency and independency, multi-dimensional dependence, forecast and scenarios. Afterwards, demand side management, which is one of the other approaches for dealing with these uncertainties, is investigated and different demand response programs and some methods to model them are presented. Finally, the effect of different electricity market schemes and relevant optimization methods to mitigate the variations of renewable energy sources are discussed.

However, the RE production is mostly inflexible. The risk of unmatching electricity market grows. Tools such as power plant flexibility, import/export, demand side management, storage and RE curtailment are developed to handle this problem. This study focuses on the energy storage mix required for the energy of the electricity system to high RE shares. An hour based model is developed in order to optimise the renewable energy and storage assets by maximising the energy return on investment (EROI) while respecting power fluxes constraints. The model is used to quantify the storage needs for the energy transition of Belgium. An in-depth analysis is performed for four scenarios. Depending on the RE deployment and nuclear share, EROI between 5 and 10.5 are obtained. Large scale storage is required as soon as the energy mix has more than 30% of RE. With more than 75% of RE, power to gas becomes unavoidable. This study highlights that curtailment can be limited to less than 5% of RE production.

A correct energy saving strategy therefore should always focus on the use of suitable techniques to reduce this energy consumption. As proved by the modern theories on comfort, less strict values can be accepted for the internal humidity set points without compromising indoor comfort conditions. In addition, Demand Controlled Ventilation (DCV) gives the opportunity to reduce energy requirements. This paper investigates the opportunities offered by the installation of a DCV system and a Building Management System (BMS) able to perform long term monitoring of the HVAC system in a real case study.

Starting from the experimental data recorded by BMS, an optimization of the control strategies and simple tuning actions of the DCV controller were possible. Results validate the use of more flexible set points of indoor relative humidity and long term on-line tuning even in absence of self-learning control systems, as well as they highlight the achievement of remarkable energy savings thanks to these actions.

Variance of electricity tariff has influenced the optimal solutions to power management. Current power management methods for stand-alone green ships cannot be applied to this new situation. To enable tariff-driven power management, a unified model is proposed for a green ship under different time-of-use (TOU) tariffs. In the proposed model, diesel generation, solar energy, and battery storage could support auxiliary power demand, and the surplus of solar energy could be sold to grid when the ship is connected to grid. A power flow dispatching problem is then formulated as the optimization of operational cost. To cope with variance of tariff, solar energy, and on-board load demand, a receding horizon control approach is employed to ensure a closed-loop control mechanism.

The process can be automated by means of an Energy Management System that chooses the best schedule while satisfying the user\u2019s constraints on the maximum tolerable delays. In turn, users\u2019 thresholds on delay tolerance may slowly change over time.

Unlike earlier research studies that either have assumed all the appliance jobs are interruptible or power-shiftable and that the electricity prices as well as the availability of renewable resources are known, this paper focuses on more challenging scenarios in which appliance jobs are non-interruptible and non-power-shiftable, the electricity prices vary with the overall load of the entire grid in real-time, and the renewable power generation is uncertain. Because home solar systems are widely available, this paper assumes that each consumer in the grid can have a photovoltaic system and a side battery. Collected solar energy can be used to meet a consumer's individual power demand, stored in the battery for future use, or sold back to the grid during peak hours to lower electricity bills and the overall load on the entire grid. To solve this problem, a two-stage robust optimization model is proposed, and the C&CG method is utilized to solve it. However, to solve the problem more efficiently when the number of consumers and appliance jobs is large, a second approach called SRDSM is proposed. The SRDSM algorithm consists of two parts: The first part is a job scheduling algorithm that minimizes electricity costs for all consumers. The second part is a power management algorithm based on dynamic programming that reduces the energy cost further by utilizing renewable energy. The numerical results show that, although the C&CG method produces optimal solutions, the SRDSM algorithm is much more scalable and efficient when the problem size is large. \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Ltd", "2018"]

Game-theoretic DSM is an appealing decentralized approach for collaboratively scheduling the usage of domestic electrical appliances within a set of households while meeting the users' preferences about the usage time. The drawback of distributed DSM protocols is that they require each user to communicate his/her own energy consumption patterns, which may leak sensitive information regarding private habits. This paper proposes a distributed privacy-friendly DSM system that preserves users' privacy by integrating data aggregation and perturbation techniques: users decide their schedule according to aggregated consumption measurements perturbed by means of additive white Gaussian noise. We evaluate the noise power and the number of users required to achieve a given privacy level, quantified by means of the increase of the information entropy of the aggregated energy consumption pattern. The performance of our proposed DSM system is compared to the one of a benchmark system that does not support privacy preservation in terms of total bill, peak demand, and convergence time. Results show that privacy can be improved at the cost of increasing the peak demand and the number of game iterations, whereas the total bill is only marginally incremented. \u00a9 2017 IEEE.", "2017"]

The present study analyzes the potential benefits of operating the heat pump of a plus-energy dwelling which participates in a dynamic pricing market, benefitting from the thermal storage capacity of the building. The software TRNSYS 17 has been used to model the building and the supply system. A validation of the model was carried out by using available measurements of the dwelling. Three setpoint temperature scenarios have been considered for sixteen different strategies which depend on temperature and electricity price thresholds, with the aim of determining which alternatives could lead to significant savings while maintaining an acceptable thermal comfort. Several factors such as cost savings, heat pump consumption, ratio of self-consumption of the dwelling and use of the heat pump during peak hours were also evaluated in every case. The results show that dynamic price thresholds should be used instead of fixed price thresholds, which may cause low activations of the heat pump or overheat the building above the comfort limits. Cost savings up to 25% may be achieved by using optimal strategies, increasing the self-consumption ratio, having almost no influence on the thermal comfort and achieving significant peak reductions on the grid.

However, it is of considerable difficulties to precisely forecast the undispatchable and intermittent wind and solar power generations. The uncoordinated charging of PEVs imposes further challenges on the unit commitment in modern grid operations. In this paper, all these factors are comprehensively investigated for the first time within a novel hybrid unit commitment framework, namely UCsRP, which considers a wide range of scenarios in renewable generations and demand side management of dispatchable PEVs load. UCsRP is however an extremely challenging optimisation problem not only due to the large scale, mixed integer and nonlinearity, but also due to the double uncertainties relating to the renewable generations and PEV charging and discharging. In this paper, a meta-heuristic solving tool is introduced for solving the UCsRP problem. A key to improve the reliability of the unit commitment is to generate a range of scenarios based on multiple distributions of renewable generations under different prediction errors and extreme predicted value conditions. This is achieved by introducing a novel multi-zone sampling method. A comprehensive study considering four different cases of unit commitment problems with various weather and season scenarios using real power system data are conducted and solved, and smart management of charging and discharging of PEVs are incorporated into the problem.

Although participants were financially motivated, norms of lifestyle and convenience, as well as competing household values of energy management were the largest barriers to home energy management. Conclusions: This study showcases challenges for engaging homeowners with home energy management technologies due to norms as well as competing household interests. Nuanced findings as an outcome of this study framed around energy cultures can influence future studies on smart grid engagement and consumer behaviour with larger samples sizes. In particular, future studies can further investigate the motivations and barriers surrounding residential energy cultures, how to engage different 'cultures of consumption' within households, and elements to effectively educate consumers beyond disaggregated feedback. \u00a9 2018 The Author(s).", "2018"]

Drawing on two Dutch smart grid projects, we observe that in the smart grid transition the balancing of (renewable) supply and demand in energy grids becomes the key priority of grid managers. This shift becomes translated at the household level through so called \u2018teleoaffective structures\u2019 of energy practices which motivate and direct the behaviour of householders towards flexible timing-of-demand. New grid objectives are codified in the rules of social practice concerning the use of flexibility instruments (notably time-of-day pricing) and are materialized in monitoring devices, smart appliances, and energy storage. We investigated which domestic practices are most open for flexible timing-of-use. Cleaning practices were found to be most suitable for demand-side response, whereas practices implied in ambiance regulation, leisure, cooking and eating, align only with some flexibility instruments. Next, an analytical focus on linkages between social practices was used to specify opportunities and barriers to sustainable domestic energy consumption. In the concluding section, we argue that householder engagement with sustainability goals should be safeguarded from the flexibility instruments, goals and strategies that seem to turn this engagement into grid management performed for financial benefits only. \u00a9 2017 The Authors", "2017"]

The generation system usually supplies a storage system with the capability to store the produced energy for satisfying a user\u2019s future demand. In this paper, the main objective is to determine the best strategies of energy consumption and optimal storage capacities for residential users, which are both closely related to the energy cost of the users. Energy management with storage capacity optimization is studied by considering the cost of renewable energy generation, depreciation cost of storage and bidirectional energy trading. To minimize the cost to residential users, the non-cooperative game-theoretic method is employed to formulate the model that combines energy consumption and storage capacity optimization. The distributed algorithm is presented to understand the Nash equilibrium which can guarantee Pareto optimality in terms of minimizing the energy cost. Simulation results show that the proposed game approach can significantly benefit residential users. Furthermore, it also contributes to reducing the peak-to-average ratio (PAR) of overall energy demand. \u00a9 2018, The Author(s).", "2018"]

Integrating large shares of variable renewable energy generation to a system with a large share of inflexible generation, such as nuclear power, can however lead to a decrease in system efficiency as the availability of variable renewable energy and demand can be in mismatch, further leading only to sub-optimal economic dispatch of generation units. The focus of this paper is on demand shifting in the residential and commercial sector. We estimate the hourly flexible demand potential and model the management of this end-user demand-side resource according to availability of variable RES generation. Moreover, to analyse the implications of demand shifting on energy system level, we model the Finnish energy system in future scenarios with large amounts of wind power, photovoltaics and nuclear power.

Additionally, recent policy developments indicate a decreased tariff in the future for electricity sold to the grid by households with DERs. Energy Storage Systems (ESS) combined with Demand Side Management (DSM) can improve the self-consumption of Photovoltaic (PV) generated electricity and decrease grid imbalance between supply and demand. Household Energy Storage (HES) and Community Energy Storage (CES) are two promising storage scenarios for residential electricity prosumers. This paper aims to assess and compare the technical and economic feasibility of both HES and CES. To do that, mathematical optimization is used in both scenarios, where a Home Energy Management System (HEMS) schedules the allocation of energy from the PV system, battery and the grid in order to satisfy the power demand of households using a dynamic pricing scheme. The problem is formulated as a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) with the objective of minimizing the costs of power received from the grid. Data from real demand and PV generation profiles of 39 households in a pilot project initiated by the Distribution System Operator (DSO) \u2019Enexis\u2019 in Breda, the Netherlands, is used for the numerical analysis.

Nonetheless, due to differences in definition and quantification methodologies for energy flexibility, comparing results between such studies is difficult. With a review and applied evaluation of existing definitions and quantification methodologies this paper aims at assessing the applicability, benefits and drawbacks of each quantification methodology. The conducted review shows that energy flexibility definitions found in the literature have their particularities despite sharing the same principle that energy flexibility is the ability to adapt the energy profile without jeopardizing technical and comfort constraints. The survey of quantification methodologies reveals two main approaches to quantify energy flexibility. A first approach quantifies energy flexibility indirectly using past data and assuming a specific energy system and/or energy market context. The second approach directly predicts the energy flexibility that a building can offer to the energy system in a bottom-up manner. While applications for both approaches were identified, this paper focuses on the latter. By applying methodologies that follow this second approach to a common case study, three common properties of energy flexibility were observed: i) the temporal flexibility; ii) the amplitude of power modulation; iii) and the associated cost. \u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.", "2018"]

The characteristics of EPD are very different between sources with short but frequent wind power droughts and rare but long hydro power ones. Solar power droughts are very region-dependent with much longer droughts in Northern Europe. ESD are next characterized in a 100% renewable energy scenario.

To improve the effectiveness of EMS in the context of demand response, an alternative EMS control framework driven by resident behavior patterns is developed. Using hidden Markov modeling techniques, the EMS detects consumer behavior from real-time aggregate consumption and a pre-built dictionary of reference models. These models capture variations in consumer habits as a function of daily living activity sequence. Following a training period, the system identifies the best fit model which is used to estimate the current state of the resident. When a request to activate a time-shiftable appliance is made, the control agent compares grid signals, user convenience constraints, and the current consumer state estimate to predict the likelihood that the future aggregate load exceeds a consumption threshold during the operating cycle of the requested device. Based on the outcome, the control agent initiates or defers the activation request.

While other papers have explored price response behavior internally through microeconomic principles, many factors affect a household's electricity use, including the construction of the dwelling, outdoor air temperature, and efficiency of the air conditioner. We have superimposed a physical model, which determines hourly power loads, with a utility maximization component. The dwelling itself is calibrated to one in Saudi Arabia, but we test households that have various preferences in their utility function, levels of thermal insulation, and income. We further analyze a wide range of electricity pricing schemes; some are progressive tariffs, while one is defined hourly.

Different applications and processes exist, which can provide Demand Response (DR) potential by shifting or shedding their load. The availability of most applications depend on the ambient temperature and/or time of day. Furthermore, their commitment is limited by technical restrictions, e.g. shifting time. In this paper, the availability and the flexibility of DR is analysed to investigate its role for the system integration of RES in Germany. In a first step, DR potential on an hourly basis is calculated for today and for future years. In a second step, the use of DR in an electricity system with different RES shares is investigated with an electricity market model. Results show, DR reduces RES curtailment. However, due to its limited availability and flexibility, it cannot integrate high amount of RES surplus over a longer period. Instead, it balances short-term fluctuation of the residual load curve. The exploited potential varies between DR applications because of their different characteristics. Therefore, focused (on selected applications) rather than broad development of DR potential is needed to shape the future energy system in a cost efficient way. \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Ltd", "2018"]

Except for the direct energy consumption of the household sector, people's consumption activities also indirectly affect the energy consumption of multiple production sectors. Previous studies have shed light upon consumer-oriented energy consumption and carbon emission, however, the critical problem of sector-to-sector energy linkages between supply side and demand side has not been fully addressed. Besides, there also lacks sufficient research on the energy conservation potential of residents\u2019 lifestyle change. This paper investigates the direct and indirect impact of household consumption activities on energy consumption in China from the consumers\u2019 lifestyle perspective based on the input-output analysis. The relationship between household energy consumption and industrial energy consumption and the effect of lifestyle change on energy conservation are also considered. It is estimated that China's energy consumption caused by household consumption activities in 2012 is 29141.97 PJ in total, which accounts for 24.7% of the total final energy consumption. The indirect energy consumption of household consumption activities is 1.35 times more than the direct energy consumption. Housing activities cause the most indirect energy consumption, and the smelting and pressing industry of ferrous metal is the most energy-consuming industrial sector influenced by household consumption. We also find that adopting low-carbon consumption pattern and accelerating the decrease of energy intensity are both effective means to reduce the total energy consumption by scenario analysis. Finally the energy conservation potential by comparing different types of household consumption behaviors is revealed to make policy makers form vivid impressions on the importance of demand side regulation. \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Ltd", "2017"]

While temporal flexibility (e.g. load shedding, load shifting) is already discussed intensively in literature, spatial load migration still is an under-researched type of DSF. Spatial load migration allows us to instantly migrate power-consuming activities among different locations. Data centers (DCs) are power-intensive and process information goods. Since information goods are easily transferable through communication networks, power-intensive processing of information goods is not necessarily tied to a specific location. Consequently, geographically distributed DCs inherit\u2014in theory\u2014a considerable potential to globally migrate load. We analyze the economics of spatially migrating load to provide balancing power using geographically distributed DCs. We assure that neither of the participating electricity grids will be burdened by this mechanism.

In addition, we find that current scenarios favor the migration of negative balancing power.

In countries with energy-intensive industries, flexibility may be increased through industrial demand side management (IDSM). In most studies, the potential of IDSM is estimated from a technical or theoretical viewpoint. However, IDSM capacity is only utilized if the industry finds it profitable, and thus the economic potential should also be assessed. The focus of this paper is on the intra-day IDSM potential of a paper mill site that is active in the Nordic power market. An optimization model is built to estimate the costs that occur when the paper mill executes regulating power bids, if the original production schedule has been optimized against a spot price forecast. The costs are estimated for different sizes of bids and a marginal cost curve is provided for pricing them. Using this marginal cost curve, the market potential of the case mill site is assessed. It is found that this potential is greatly influenced by the costs of executing regulating power bids. The results indicate that transmission system operators and policy makers should account for economic factors when assessing the potential of market based IDSM. \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Ltd", "2017"]

We consider a fully competitive CES operator in a non-cooperative Stackelberg game, a benevolent CES operator that has socially favorable regulations with competitive users, and a centralized cooperative CES operator that minimizes the total community energy cost. The former two game-theoretic systems consider that the CES operator first maximizes their revenue by setting a price signal and trading energy with the grid. Then the users with PV panels play a non-cooperative repeated game following the actions of the CES operator to trade energy with the CES device and the grid to minimize energy costs. The centralized CES operator cooperates with the users to minimize the total community energy cost without appropriate incentives. The non-cooperative Stackelberg game with the fully competitive CES operator has a unique Stackelberg equilibrium at which the CES operator maximizes revenue and users obtain unique Pareto-optimal Nash equilibrium CES energy trading strategies.

The paper tests the framework to determine the transferability of different types of DSM policy across 30 countries and 36 sub-national states. The method is a contextual-based analysis that matches up countries/states that have a comparable context at the proposed three levels of policy transfer: direct copying, adaptation and inspiration. The paper utilises Multi-Criteria Decision-Making analysis with 17 DSM experts to validate the breakdown of contextual factors at different levels of policy transfer. Four groups of countries are identified where policy transfer is possible at the adaptation level and seven groups of countries/states are identified at the inspiration level.

Demand response programs (DRPs) can be used to lower high energy prices in wholesale electricity markets, and ensure the security of power systems when at risk. The concern of most researchers in this field is to further unearth the potential of smart grid in the direction of demand response (DR) through enhanced demand side management (DSM) centering on the behavior of the end-user. Our model proposes a more effective way in using incentive based demand response program to help residential customers derive more benefits from smart grid. The constrained non-linear programming (CNLP) model optimizes residential consumption of electricity by shaving of load at peak and increasing of load at off-peak to help generators reduce production cost at peak times and increase revenue at of off-peaks. The model uses a credit function to regulate consumption and reward end-users for load shedding and load shifting at peaks and also at off-peaks reward end-users for increasing load. The simulated results show that, high consumption appliances are best used at dawn, midday, and at night, if consumers want to cut down cost. The corresponding effect is that, generating and distribution companies derive the right revenue from their investments by not producing beyond their capacity during peaks at high cost and maintain constant power supply in and environmentally friendly manner. \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Ltd", "2018"]

However, both the reshaping of the load consumption curve with the displacement of deferrable loads and the optimal management of the battery bank require estimation of the daily PV generation profile. The assessment of the on-site energy production can be carried out based on weather forecast data. However, the latter are characterized by uncertainty, which may affect the achievable self-consumption rate. This work investigates the influence of weather forecast errors on the performance of home PV systems equipped with a battery bank and characterized by a certain share of deferrable loads. Two different weather forecast services are considered, referring to the annual meteorological conditions occurring in Rome, and energy consumption data for 150 different households are analysed. The self-consumption rate is maximized by solving a suitable optimization problem, while different combinations of relative battery capacity, PV-to-load ratio and share of deferrable loads are considered. Two different approaches\u2014deterministic and stochastic\u2014are adopted and compared with an ideal approach where the PV generation profile is perfectly forecasted. The results show that the adoption of the deterministic approach leads to a reduction in the achievable self-consumption rate in the range of 0.5\u20134.5% compared to the ideal approach. The adoption of a stochastic approach further reduces the deviations from the ideal case, especially in the case of consumption profiles with a high share of deferrable loads.

Many studies suggest occupancy detection is critical in promoting building energy efficiency because it is premised on the idea of avoiding unnecessary waste while providing sufficient service. In this paper, we propose the integration of an iBeacon-enabled indoor positioning system (IPS) and a Variable Air Volume (VAV) heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) system to optimize system control and save energy based on high-resolution occupancy detection. The proposed system aims to match thermal service with the spatial distribution of occupants and redefine occupancy as a dynamic spatial occupancy distribution (DSOD) occupancy matrix. For this reason, this paper proposes measuring spatial occupancy by meshing large indoor spaces into zones and patches, and uses a feature-scaled artificial neural network algorithm to map the spatial IPS signal patterns. After acquiring the detailed spatial distribution, we also developed a ventilation control mechanism based on occupancy distribution. To validate the proposed control mechanism, we compared it with other traditional controllers in an on-site experiment and through a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation.

The PCC-TES system is proposed to be integrated with the vapor compression refrigeration cycle of an air conditioning (AC) system. The use of this PCC material is novel because of its unique material and thermal characteristics as compared to ice or chilled water that are predominantly used in commercial TES systems for air cooling applications. The work of this paper proposed and tested a hypothesis, which suggests that integrating a conventional AC with a PCC-TES would result in significant benefits concerning compressor size, compressor efficiency, electricity consumed and CO2 emissions. The proposed integration would also contribute to reduce electricity demand during peak hours and reduce necessity to build more expensive power plants and distribution lines. To test the hypothesis, a simulation model in Aspen Plus\u00ae software was prepared. However, Aspen Plus\u00ae does not have a built-in library to predict PCC's melting and solidification behaviors. Therefore, an analytical heat transfer model was written as a system of equations in Fortran code into Aspen Plus\u00ae calculation block to simulate the phase change behavior and associated characteristics.

The first part simulates the AC's refrigeration loop using the built-in Aspen Plus\u00ae components and the second part implements the PCC heat transfer model written within the calculation block of Aspen Plus\u00ae.

Simulated performance of the proposed integration between the AC and the PCC-TES indicated the potential to (1) downsize the compressor by 50%, (2) lower electrical consumption by the compressor by 30%, (3) lower CO2 emissions by 30%, and (4) double the compressor efficiency during off and mid peak hours.

To do so, one may follow two paths, reduce the energy use in buildings (demand) or provide the required energy in more efficient ways (supply). In the literature, extensive research has been made on both fronts and at different levels of detail resulting in a myriad of tools unique to specific stages in the development timeframe of a district energy project. This manuscript describes a modeling workflow based on a new Rhinoceros-based plugin that combines an Urban Building Energy Model with a network topology optimization and a heat generation scenario model bridging the gap between the planning phase and the design phase. The new plugin builds on the foundation of umi, a Rhino-based link to Radiance and EnergyPlus developed at the MIT Sustainable Design Lab, as an addition to the demand simulation module.

Batteries retired from electric vehicle usage retain 70% to 80% of their capacity and can be re-purposed as stationary storage system at reduced cost. However, they have mismatched aging conditions and unbalanced state-of-charge levels. Under typical series-parallel connection, the cells in a pack are prone to over charging or discharging due to deviated cycling conditions and misestimated states. The demonstrated battery management system included an extended Kalman filter based states estimator, enhanced current shunting, and protective circuitry to ensure system safety. One novel contribution was the introduction of a worst-difference state-of-charge estimation scheme for the battery pack, which places more computational resources on the battery cell of the worst health. The scheme provided satisfactory overall estimation accuracy and offered a method to optimize computational cost when large number of battery cells was integrated. In addition, a function was proposed to indicate the overall states of the entire energy storage system by aggregating the states of the battery cells within. Therefore, the energy management unit was able to dispatch the battery assembly as a unified pack. Three decision-table-based control strategies were demonstrated with objectives to maximize economic benefits, minimize grid energy consumption, or a balance of both. The data obtained from the demonstrating system located in Davis, CA showed that the battery energy storage system was able to successfully mitigate solar intermittency and energy demand fluctuation by charging from excess solar energy and discharging during the period of peak demand.

In P2P energy sharing, prosumers directly trade energy with each other to achieve a win-win outcome. From the perspectives of power systems, P2P energy sharing has the potential to facilitate local energy balance and self-sufficiency. A systematic index system was developed to evaluate the performance of various P2P energy sharing mechanisms based on a multiagent-based simulation framework. The simulation framework is composed of three types of agents and three corresponding models. Two techniques, i.e. step length control and learning process involvement, and a last-defence mechanism were proposed to facilitate the convergence of simulation and deal with the divergence. The evaluation indexes include three economic indexes, i.e. value tapping, participation willing and equality, and three technical indexes, i.e. energy balance, power flatness and self-sufficiency. They are normalised and further synthesized to reflect the overall performance. The proposed methods were applied to simulate and evaluate three existing P2P energy sharing mechanisms, i.e. the supply and demand ratio (SDR), mid-market rate (MMR) and bill sharing (BS), for residential customers in current and future scenarios of Great Britain. Simulation results showed that both of the step length control and learning process involvement techniques improve the performance of P2P energy sharing mechanisms with moderate ramping/learning rates. The results also showed that P2P energy sharing has the potential to bring both economic and technical benefits for Great Britain. In terms of the overall performance, the SDR mechanism outperforms all the other mechanisms, and the MMR mechanism has good performance when with moderate PV penetration levels.

When analyzing data from discrete choice experiments it is typically assumed that people make rational utility maximizing decisions, i.e., that they consider all of the attribute information and compare all alternatives. However, mounting evidence shows that people use a wide range of simplifying strategies that are inconsistent with utility maximization. We use a flexible model capturing a two-stage decision process. In the first stage, respondents are allowed to eliminate from their choice set alternatives that contain an unacceptable level, in this case restrictions on the use of heating and electricity. In the second stage, respondents choose in a compensatory manner between the remaining alternatives. Our results show that about half of the respondents choose according to an elimination-by-aspects strategy, and that, on average, they are unwilling to accept any restrictions on heating in the evening or electricity use irrespective of time-of-day. Furthermore, considering elimination-by-aspects behavior leads to a downward shift in elicited willingness-to-accept. We discuss implications for policy. \u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.", "2018"]

In the recent decades, performing Demand Response (DR) is one of the most efficient ways to improve the performance of power distribution systems in terms of power loss, and investment costs. The LSEs can implements some strategies like offering incentives to customers to change their consumption pattern with the aim of reducing power loss, improving asset management and increasing the profits. On the other hand, the end users can participate in DR programs to decrease electricity bills and earn monetary incentives from LSEs proportionate to their contributions to the energy loss reduction. In this paper, Distribution Locational Marginal Price (DLMP) instead of time-based pricing mechanism is applied to bill the customers. In the proposed strategy, the energy bill of customers and power loss of the system are simultaneously decreased. For dealing with uncertainties, stochastic variables computation module is designed which generates several scenarios by Monte Carlo simulation at each hour. The operation of household resources and appliances are optimized through a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP), which has a two-stage stochastic model.

This naive supposition fails to reflect the contribution of network users to network peak flows, which actually is the driver for network reinforcement.

Such DDR schemes can be realized by low-cost wireless networks. To this end, we propose the use of a randomized alternating direction method of multipliers to develop a fully DDR algorithm. Notably, the proposed DDR algorithm is communication-efficient because it can yield promising power balance performance using a few times of neighbor-wise message exchanges. Moreover, the proposed DDR algorithm does not need synchronization between customers and is robust against random communication errors. For performing online demand response control, we combine the proposed DDR algorithm with the rolling-window-based modelpredictive control method, and simple load and RES forecasting methods.

The proposed CEMS utilizes dynamic pricing (DP) and a standard deviation biased genetic algorithm (SDBGA) in minimizing the DSM window to be allocated to the DSM loads of consumers based on the multi-objective constraints. The Medupi power plant which has been modelled to utilize carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) technology is used in carrying out the dispatch of the participating DSM loads (cloth washers, cloth dryers and dish washers) for 100,000 random residential customers.

First, a unique set of appliance and solar signatures were constructed using a high-resolution implementation of Karhunen Lo\u00e9ve expansion (KLE). Then, different operating modes of multi-state appliances were automatically classified utilizing a spectral clustering based method. Finally, using the total power demand profile, through a subspace component power level matching algorithm, the turned ON appliances along with their operating modes and power levels as well as the solar influx amount were found at each time point. The proposed NILM method was first successfully validated on six synthetically generated houses (with solar units) using real household data taken from the Reference Energy Disaggregation Dataset (REDD) - USA. Then, in order to demonstrate the scalability of the proposed NILM method, it was employed on a set of 400 individual households. From that, reliable estimations were obtained for the total residential solar generation and for the total load that can be shed to provide reserve services. Finally, through a developed prediction technique, NILM results observed from 400 households during four days in the recent past were utilized to predict the next day's total load that can be shed. \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Ltd", "2017"]

For projects where sampling has to be done, these costs can be the most significant driver of the overall M&V project cost, especially in multi-year (longitudinal) projects. This study presents a method for calculating efficient combined metering and survey sample designs for longitudinal M&V of retrofit projects. In this paper, a building lighting retrofit case study is considered. A Dynamic Linear Model (DLM) with Bayesian forecasting is used. The Bayesian component of the model determines the sample size-weighted uncertainty bounds on multi-year metering studies, with results from previous years incorporated into the overall calculation to reduce forecast uncertainty. The DLM is compared to previous meter sampling methods, and an investigation into the robustness of efficient sampling plans is also conducted. The Mellin Transform Moment Calculation method is then used to combine the DLM with a Dynamic Generalised Linear Model describing the uncertainty in survey results for the longitudinal monitoring of lamp population decay. A genetic algorithm is employed to optimise the combined sampling design. Besides the reliable uncertainty quantification features of the method, results show a reduction in sampling costs of 40% for simple random sampling, and approximately 26.6% for stratified sampling, as compared to realistic benchmark methods. \u00a9 2017 Elsevier B.V.", "2017"]

In this paper we analyse the effects of such losses from two perspectives: from that of consumption and from that of generation. Given that end-user consumption varies across the day, consumption has direct implications for electricity losses. Indeed, demand-side management policies seek to encourage consumers to use less energy during peak hours and to reduce network congestion. At the same time, from the perspective of generation, the recent growth in distributed generation has modified the traditional, unidirectional, downward flows in electricity systems. This affects losses as energy is produced in the lower voltage network, which is closer to points of consumption. In this paper we evaluate the impact of consumption patterns and different generation technologies on the energy losses and the cost of losses. To do so, we draw on data from a real electricity system with a high level of renewable penetration, namely, that of Spain between 2011 and 2013. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to analyse the real impact of consumption and the effect of each generation technology on energy losses, offering an opportunity to evaluate the potential benefits of demand-side management policies and distributed generation. Losses are divided between transmission and distribution levels, which is also a novelty that allows us to better define our regulatory recommendations aimed at exploiting to the full these potential benefits. Our results should serve as a baseline for countries at the early stages of implementing these policies. \u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.", "2018"]

It considers the components which have significant impact on cost optimization, e.g., storage, renewables, and microgrid. The model utilizes load and source scheduling, and energy trading strategies for cost optimization. It also addresses the inconvenience created to the users by delaying certain tasks. The contributions of the research are threefold. First, to our knowledge, this is the first optimal model which integrates DSM with P2P energy trading. The solutions of the proposed model determine optimal microgrid energy and price for P2P trading, which was not considered previously. Second, P2P energy trading in the microgrid potentially results in an unfair cost distribution among the participating households. We address this unfair cost distribution problem by employing Pareto optimality, ensuring that no households will be worse off to improve the cost of others. Third, our proposed trading strategy considers total cost optimization in a microgrid. The model utilizes all available energy to minimize energy cost. Therefore, there is a very low risk of energy waste, which is typically neglected in other energy trading strategies. \u00a9 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.", "2017"]

It is therefore important to accurately understand the characteristics of appliance use and to embed this understanding into predictive models to support load forecast and building design decisions. Bottom-up techniques that account for the variability in socio-demographic characteristics of the occupants and their behaviour patterns constitute a powerful tool to this end, and are potentially able to inform the design of Demand Side Management strategies in homes. To this end, this paper presents a comparison of alternative strategies to stochastically model the temporal energy use of low-load appliances (meaning those whose annual energy share is individually small but significant when considered as a group). In particular, discrete-time Markov processes and survival analysis have been explored. Rigorous mathematical procedures, including cluster analysis, have been employed to identify a parsimonious strategy for the modelling of variations in energy demand over time of the four principle categories of small appliances: audio-visual, computing, kitchen and other small appliances. From this it is concluded that a model of the duration for which appliances survive in discrete states expressed as bins in fraction of maximum power demand performs best. This general solution may be integrated with relative ease with dynamic simulation programs, to complement existing models of relatively large load appliances for the comprehensive simulation of household appliance use. \u00a9 2016", "2017"]

The supply and demand variability is found in different time scales (i.e., instantaneous, diurnal, and seasonal). The nominal discharge duration of multiple storage options can be matched effectively for variability in all relevant time scales. An optimum mix of storage options is important to design a cost-effective system. This paper proposes a generic sizing methodology using pinch analysis and design space for hybrid energy storage in a PV-based isolated power system. Pinch analysis utilises a time series simulation of the system where generation should always exceed the load. The methodology defines the design space as feasible combinations of short, medium, and long-term storage size and PV array rating for the given loads. These design space curves are approximated by quadratic equations and the correlations are used as constraints to determine the optimal mix of supply and storage that minimise the life cycle cost. Four different practical cases in Indian context \u2014a remote village, telecom tower, welding shop, and a standby system for a lift load \u2013 are analysed to illustrate the sizing method. As an example, the optimal size for a PV based microgrid supplying a remote telecom tower with an average load of 72 kWh/day is 40 kWp of PV, 5 m3 of hydrogen storage and 58 kWh of battery. The proposed methodology extends the design space approach to obtain an optimal minimum cost solution. \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Ltd", "2018"]

As the economic characteristics of the electricity sector tend to discourage investments in smart grids, many countries have adopted incentive policies to foster the deployment of new technologies, which vary according to the particular characteristics of each country. Therefore, the design of specific public policies for Brazil must consider not only the motivations involved, but also the existing challenges for the implementation of smart grids and the socio-economic context.

The methodology to shape this set of policies consisted of a thorough literature review of international experiences, combined with meetings with experts in several domains.

Counter-factual models to estimate the baselines are vulnerable for gaming. In this paper, a novel demand response contract between a user and an aggregator is developed to induce individual rationality (voluntary participation) and asymptotic incentive-compatibility (truthfulness) through the probability of call, which is the chance of a consumer to be selected by the aggregator to serve as demand response resource at a given period. In this approach, a consumer self-reports his baseline and reduction capacity, given a payment scheme that includes cost of electricity, incentive price, and penalty caused by any deviation between self-reported and actual energy consumption. Another important feature of this approach, different from the classic solutions, is that a participant agent does not require reporting marginal utility (energy preference), and only announces information in terms of energy. A two-stage stochastic programming problem is proposed from the demand side to understand the consumer rational decisions under this contract. As result, the aggregator decides randomly what users are called to perform the energy reduction in order to manage the truth-telling behavior of each agent through the probability of call. Mathematical proofs and numerical studies are provided to demonstrate the properties and advantages of this contract in limiting gaming opportunities and in terms of its implementation. \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Ltd", "2018"]

However, renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar power, have an intrinsic variability that can seriously affect the stability of the energy system if they account for a high percentage of the total generation. The Energy Flexibility of buildings is commonly suggested as part of the solution to alleviate some of the upcoming challenges in the future demand-respond energy systems (electrical, district heating and gas grids). Buildings can supply flexibility services in different ways, e.g. utilization of thermal mass, adjustability of HVAC system use (e.g. heating/cooling/ventilation), charging of electric vehicles, and shifting of plug-loads. However, there is currently no overview or insight into how much Energy Flexibility different building may be able to offer to the future energy systems in the sense of avoiding excess energy production, increase the stability of the energy networks, minimize congestion problems, enhance the efficiency and cost effectiveness of the future energy networks.

Due to its high energy density and relative robustness, the lead-acid battery is widely used for power demand management to compensate the mismatch between the m-CHP electrical output and domestic demand. However, batteries are not suited to respond effectively to high frequency power fluctuations, but when coupled to the m-CHP, they experience frequent short-term charge/discharge cycles and abrupt power changes, which significantly decreases their lifetime. This paper addresses this problem by hybridising the lead-acid battery storage with superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES) to form a hybrid energy storage system (HESS) that is coordinated by a novel sizing based droop control method. The control method for the first time considers both the capacity sizing of the HESS technologies and the droop control method of the battery and the SMES. A hardware in the loop test circuit is developed coupling with the real time digital simulator (RTDS) to verify the performance of the HESS with the new control algorithm. The experimental results show that control method is able to exploit the different characteristics of the SMES and the battery to meet the mismatch of m-CHP power generation and domestic demand.

Since water heaters store energy, they are well-suited to load management. However, existing approaches have focused on the electrical supply side, ignoring the obvious link between the user and the grid: individual hot water consumption patterns. This paper proposes a load spreading approach in which water heaters compete for access to the heating medium. The proposed smart grid solution takes grid load limits, real-time temperature measurements, water usage patterns, individual user comfort, and heater meta-data into consideration. The scheduler only turns on the heaters with the highest level of need, but limits the number of on heaters to ensure that the grid load stays below a set limit for a set time. The method is evaluated by simulation against various heater set temperature levels, and for various load limits, and compared with ripple control and actual consumption measured in a field trial of 34 water heaters. The proposed algorithm reduces the load from 62 kW to 20, 30, 40, and 50 kW (vs. 106 kW for full ripple control). The resulting number of unwanted cold events is fewer than for ripple control, and only slightly more than no control, while reducing the total energy by 14% from a user-optimised natural experiment. \u00a9 2018 International Energy Initiative", "2018"]

For this, we compare rankings of consumers in two scenarios first, when only the aggregate outcome of the top consumers matters, then when the relative ordering of the consumers is important. We illustrate our methodology using two individual consumption models that extract thermal (temperature-sensitive) and occupant-driven components from single-point source smart meter data. Moreover, we discuss how a demand response program that selects the consumers with the most potential for energy reduction based on model results may achieve similar results as in the ideal case when separately monitored HVAC data is used. \u00a9 2016 IEEE.", "2018"]

This paper assesses ex ante the effects of free riding on the cost-effectiveness of a rebate program that promotes the adoption of energy-efficient heating systems, relying on contingent valuation choice experiments carried out through identical representative surveys in eight EU Members States. The analysis distinguishes between strong and weak free riders: strong free riders already plan to adopt a new heating system in the next five years; weak free riders decide to purchase once propositioned with an attractive technology package (and therefore do not require a rebate to adopt). The reservation rebates for incentivized adopters (those who decide to adopt because of a rebate) differ substantially across countries. On average, they amount to approximately 40% of the heating system's purchasing price, suggesting generally high opportunity costs for premature upgrades. The reservation rebate and weak free-ridership vary with income, risk and time preferences, and environmental identity. At a rebate level that corresponds to half the purchase price of the offered heating system, the estimated share of free riders exceeded 50% for most countries, with a typically higher share of weak free riders than strong free riders. Specific rebate cost estimates (in \u20ac/tCO2) differ considerably across countries, suggesting that cooperation can yield budgetary benefits. \u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.", "2017"]

The proposed CFC scheme is a communication-free coordination among fast responding devices: thermostatically controlled loads (TCLs), photovoltaic power systems, battery energy storage systems, and a slow responding diesel generator (DZ). The fast responding devices are deployed to achieve a swift frequency regulation in transient state. In steady state, these devices are returned to their normal operating condition by changing loading conditions of the DZ without employing interdevice communication. The proposed control strategy not only achieves frequency regulation in adherence to IEEE Standard 1547, but also maintains customers' quality of service while manipulating TCLs for frequency regulation. A comprehensive study of the proposed CFC scheme is carried out on a modified IEEE 13-bus balanced industrial distribution network using MATLAB/Simulink. In addition, real-time performances of the CFC scheme have been validated experimentally using OPAL-RT simulator, and a well-programmed TMS320F28335 microcontroller.

A combination of these two programs is proposed in this paper with the merged program to be real time with incentive demand response. The time based demand response programs can be improved by using smart metering infrastructure and different resources.

Their ability to store energy makes them a significant opportunity for emerging smart home energy management systems. One approach to evaluating the potential of hot water cylinders under smart control is to simulate electricity demand via a physical model of a cylinder together with assumed hot water usage patterns. Determining the accuracy of these simulations is made difficult by the lack of detailed data on cylinder variables and household hot water usage. This results in simulation methods that potentially miss essential features or are overly complex. To address this issue, we first propose a statistical fidelity measure that can be used to compare simulated with monitored electricity demand time series from an individual cylinder. We then present a minimal simulation method that achieves reasonable fidelity with monitored demand. The proposed method is particularly useful for simulating individual households using only electricity time-series data for the purpose of evaluating smart home management scenarios. \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Ltd", "2018"]

In this work, a novel approach to derive ToU tariffs for residential prosumers is described and the potential impact is verified in a pilot network within the distribution grid of Cyprus comprised of three hundred prosumers. This pilot network acts as a test-bed for defining the baseline scenario and subsequently verifying the developed ToU tariffs. The ToU block periods were determined by combining statistical analysis and a hybrid optimization function that utilizes annealing driven pattern search algorithms. The ToU rates were calculated by exploiting an optimization function that maintained a neutral electricity bill in the case where the load profile remained unchanged. The impact of the derived ToU tariffs was first analysed through a sensitivity analysis performed on the seasonal load profiles of the participants. The obtained sensitivity analysis results showed that for the summer and winter season, the maximum Load Factor (LF) was 42.83% and 33.33% respectively and occurred when load was shifted mainly to the off-peak period. Finally, with the ToU tariffs applied to the pilot network of prosumers, the effectiveness and potential response of the prosumers to the imposed tariffs, was verified. The results indicated that the LF was increased while the percentage of total consumption measured during peak hours was reduced by 3.19%, 1.03% and 1.40% for the summer, middle and winter season respectively.

A key factor prohibiting the widespread adoption of MPC for complex systems such as buildings is related to the difficulties (cost, time and effort) associated with the identification of a predictive model of a building. To overcome this problem, we introduce a novel idea for predictive control based on historical building data leveraging machine learning algorithms like regression trees and random forests. We call this approach Data-driven model Predictive Control (DPC), and we apply it to three different case studies to demonstrate its performance, scalability and robustness. In the first case study we consider a benchmark MPC controller using a bilinear building model, then we apply DPC to a data-set simulated from such bilinear model and derive a controller based only on the data. Our results demonstrate that DPC can provide comparable performance with respect to MPC applied to a perfectly known mathematical model. In the second case study we apply DPC to a 6 story 22 zone building model in EnergyPlus, for which model-based control is not economical and practical due to extreme complexity, and address a Demand Response problem. Our results demonstrate scalability and efficiency of DPC showing that DPC provides the desired power curtailment with an average error of 3%.

The proposed EMS reduces such demand uncertainty and the electricity bill for end users, at the same time. The main novelty of the proposed technique is that it does not require any change in pricing plans or user's habits, differently from classical Demand Side Management schemes. Moreover, thanks to the increased predictability of the exchanged power, utility providers are facilitated in managing the wholesale risk, for example by designing appropriate pricing schemes.

The energy loss variation is divided up into 2 terms: the energy loss variation at pick hours and off-pick period. The total cost variation consists of 3 terms: the cost of energy losses, market, and DSM activities. The proposed approach can be used to indicate the appropriate busses and network for applying DSM programs considering the energy losses.

This paper proposes the implementation of a distributed energy management framework linking demand-side management systems and supply-side management system under the given time-of-use pricing program for efficient utilization of photovoltaic power outputs; each system implements a consistent management flow composed of forecasting, operation planning, and control steps. In our framework, demand-side systems distributed in the electric distribution network manage individual energy consumption to reduce the residential operating cost by utilizing the residential photovoltaic power system and controllable energy appliances so as not to inconvenience residents. On the other hand, the supply-side system utilizes photovoltaic power maximally while maintaining the quality of electric power.

In order to evaluate the energy efficiency and guide the sustainability development, various methodologies have been proposed for energy demand management and to measure the energy efficiency performance accurately in the past decades. A systematical review of these methodologies are conducted in the present paper. First, the classification of the industrial energy efficiency index has been summarized to track the previous application studies. The single measurement indicator and the composite index benchmarking are highly recognized as the modeling tools for power industries and policy-making in worldwide countries. They are the pivotal figures to convey the fundamental information in energy systems for improving the performance in fields such as economy, environment and technology. Second, the six factors that influence the energy efficiency in industry are discussed.

This transformation will probably lead to the following trends: an increasing share of renewable energies, a shift from centralized to distributed generation and the emergence of new players in the energy market. Because of the associated integration of renewables, the grid will increasingly face problems of intermittent loads, the need to integrate smart information and communication technology, and mechanisms for demand-side management. However, these key elements of the future energy system also raise issues concerning social acceptance, as they tend to interfere with basic human needs like autonomy and privacy. Additionally, market liberalization may reshuffle existing customer utility relationships considerably.

Energy models are an important tool to assess the potential capability of demand side contributions.

The large variability in energy consumption in the EPS combined with unpredictable weather events can lead to a situation in which, to save the stability of the EPS, power limits must be introduced or even industrial customers in a given area have to be disconnected, which causes financial losses. Nowadays, a Transmission System Operator (TSO) is looking for additional solutions to reduce peak power, because existing approaches (mainly building new intervention power units or tariff programs) are not satisfactory due to the high cost of services in combination with an insufficient power reduction effect. The paper presents an approach to reduce peak loads with the use of Home Area Network (HAN) systems installed at residential units. The algorithm of the HAN system, executed by the HAN controller, is modeled using Unified Modeling Language (UML). Then using model transformation techniques, the UML model is translated into Verilog description, and is finally implemented in the Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). The advantages of the proposed approach are that with only a small loss of residential user comfort, there is a gain in energy reduction for a relatively small cost, an effective and convenient design of the HAN algorithm, and the flexible maintenance of HAN systems. The latter gain is possible thanks to using modern FPGAs, which allow for dynamic reconfiguration of the HAN controller. It means that a HAN algorithm of a selected user can be exchanged without power interruption of other residential users. A practical example illustrating the proposed approach and a calculation of the potential gains from its implementation are also presented. \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Ltd", "2018"]

Successful sharing must achieve enhanced utilization efficiency of DERs and, in the mean time, ensure voluntary participation of prosumers and a sharing-enabling aggregator. It is also desirable to incentivize the adoption of DERs. To fulfill these goals, we formulate a mathematical program with equilibrium constraints (MPEC) for DER valuation within a sharing community. The aggregator coordinates DER operations in real-time; then it solve this MPEC problem after each billing period. In doing so, the aggregator evaluates two operating costs for each prosumer: the actual cost under coordination and the counter-factual cost if the prosumer independently traded power with the aggregator. We define the difference in these two costs as the coordination surplus, which the aggregator and the prosumer split.

These methods are making energy demand adaptive to fluctuations inherent to intermittent renewable energy sources. In order to develop feasible demand-side management solutions, a better understanding of the temporality of the energy demand is needed. This paper contributes to this by focusing on the daily load profiles of energy demand for heating of Danish dwellings with heat pumps. Based on hourly recordings from 139 dwellings and employing cluster and regression analysis, the paper explores patterns (typologies) in daily heating load profiles and how these relate to socio-economic and technical characteristics of the included households. The study shows that the load profiles vary according to the external load conditions. Two main clusters were identified for both weekdays and weekends and across load segments; a main cluster with a relatively constant load profile and a minor cluster with a more distinct variation during the day. The difference between the clusters is primarily correlated with building characteristics like floor area, building year and type of space heating distribution system, while the existence of children and teenagers in the household were the only significant socio-economic variables. \u00a9 2016 Elsevier B.V.

A comparison for the Spanish market; Abstract: Conventionally the required instantaneous balance generation-load is achieved by adjusting production to fit variable consumer demand. Nowadays, a significant and increasing segment of generation is renewable. But renewable production cannot be scheduled on request since its generation is dependent on nature (wind, sun, \u2026).

Undoubtedly, the distribution networks cope with congestion issues much more often due to distributed generation and increased network use.

Re-dispatching is, however, not always an appropriate solution for local distribution networks since the limited generation units are mostly RES of uncontrollable volatility. Recovering the incurred investment costs on the other hand would trigger an increase of the network tariffs. A possible solution is to defer such an investment by utilizing the demand side resources.

The main advantage of existing PCTs is their capability to receive pricing signals from smart meters and shed HVAC load during high demand. In these cases; PCT automatically reduces the initialized set points to the levels pre-adjusted by user. However, there still exist neglected potentials for demand-side management that resides in the control and interaction of PCTs. Hence, it requires making PCTs more intelligence to learn and adapt to user's preference changes which results in adaptive demand-side management.

However, with the increase of wind power penetration level, operating power systems securely and reliably is a serious challenge due to the inherent nature of wind power intermittency. Wind power intermittency has been the major barrier for large scale wind power integration. This paper reviews past research on wind power intermittency, including its impacts on power system, how it is measured, and mitigation solutions. It has been found that as wind power integration increase, the system reverses and costs consequently increase, while the system reliability and CO2 reductions decrease. In order to mitigate wind power intermittency, studies on intermittency measurements and mitigation solutions are necessary. Existing measurements of wind power intermittency are summarized firstly. Considering the limitations of existing methods, new definitions and metrics are proposed based on our study. Then, various wind power intermittency mitigation solutions are comprehensively reviewed, including wind farms, generation-side, demand-side and energy storage.

Conventional methods, which heavily rely on physical principles, have limited power in practice as their performance is subject to many physical assumptions. By contrast, data-driven methods have gained huge interests due to their flexibility in model development and the rich data available in modern buildings. The rapid development in data science has provided advanced data analytics to tackle prediction problems in a more convenient, efficient and effective way. This paper investigates the potential of one of the most promising techniques in advanced data analytics, i.e., deep learning, in predicting 24-h ahead building cooling load profiles. Deep learning refers to a collection of machine learning algorithms which are powerful in revealing nonlinear and complex patterns in big data. Deep learning can be used either in a supervised manner to develop prediction models with given inputs and output (i.e., cooling load), or in an unsupervised manner to extract meaningful features from raw data as model inputs. This study exploits the potential of deep learning in both manners, and compares its performance in cooling load prediction with typical feature extraction methods and popular prediction techniques in the building field. The results show that deep learning can enhance the performance of building cooling load prediction, especially when used in an unsupervised manner for constructing high-level features as model inputs. Using the features extracted by unsupervised deep learning as inputs for cooling load prediction can evidently enhance the prediction performance. The findings are enlightening and could bring more flexible and effective solutions for building energy predictions. \u00a9 2017", "2017"]

It also has an important role to play in integrating variable forms of generation, such as wind and solar, into the grid. This will be a key part of any grid decarbonisation strategy. This paper describes a method that can be used to develop a new production schedule for a wide range of manufacturing facilities. The new schedule minimises either electricity costs or electricity-derived CO2 emissions. It does so by rescheduling production to low cost or low carbon periods, without loss of overall production, within the constraints of available inventory storage. A case study of a single cement plant in the UK was performed in order to determine the potential benefits of increased load-shifting DSM using this method. The alternative production scheduled showed the potential to decrease electricity costs by 4.2%. Scaled to values from a typical plant this would lead to a cost saving of 350,000, a substantial saving. A schedule optimised to minimise carbon emissions would save an estimated 2000 tonnes per year of CO2, a 4% decrease in electricity-derived emissions. It was also observed that the actual electricity consumption of the plant was considerably higher than the minimum consumption predicted by the model. This could indicate potential for significant savings in both cost and CO2 due to improvements in energy efficiency. The potential savings from DSM doubled when the prices passed to the plant were replaced with a price that varied in proportion to the wholesale cost of electricity. This indicates that a potential mutual benefit exists for both industrial consumers and electricity generators by passing on more of the variation in price. A larger share of generation from wind and solar will also lead to increased variation in prices and grid carbon intensity in future. The value of applying the method described in this paper is therefore likely to increase further in future. \u00a9 2017 The Author(s)", "2017"]

This is done by deriving data-driven optimal heating schedules (used interchangeably with policies) automatically. The optimization leverages actively learnt occupant behaviour and models for thermodynamics of the storage vessel to operate the heating mechanism - an air-source heat pump (ASHP) in this case - at the highest possible efficiency. The proposed algorithm, while tested on an ASHP, is essentially decoupled from the heating mechanism making it sufficiently robust to generalize to other types of heating mechanisms as well.

These show a reduction of energy consumption for DHW by 20% using a computationally inexpensive heuristic approach, and 27% when using a more intensive hybrid ant colony optimization based method. The energy savings are strongly dependent on occupant comfort level.

The potential of building energy flexibility depends not only on the physical characteristics of a building but also on occupant behaviour in the building. Building users will have to adopt smart technologies and to change their daily energy use behaviours or routines, if energy flexibility is to be achieved. The willingness of users to make changes will determine how much demand flexibility can be achieved in buildings and whether energy flexible buildings can be realized. This will have a considerable impact on the transition to smart grids. This study is thus to assess the perception of smart grids and energy flexible buildings by building users, and their readiness for them on a large scale. We attempted to identify the key characteristics of the ideal user of flexible buildings. A questionnaire was designed and administered as an online survey in the Netherlands. The questionnaire consisted of questions about the sociodemographic characteristics of the current users, house type, household composition, current energy use behaviour, willingness to use smart technologies, and willingness to change energy use behaviour. The survey was completed by 835 respondents, of which 785 (94%) were considered to have provided a genuine response.

Statistical analysis shows that people who are willing to use smart technologies are also willing to change their behaviour, and can thus be categorised as potentially flexible building users. Given certain assumptions, 11% of the respondents were found to be potentially flexible building users. To encourage people to be prepared for energy flexible buildings, awareness of smart grids will have to be increased, and the adoption of smart technologies may have to be promoted by providing incentives such as financial rewards. \u00a9 2017 The Author(s)", "2017"]

Demand-side management on a household level requires changes in the temporality of electricity-consuming practices in everyday life. One dominant approach to demand-side management is to influence the temporality of households' consumption patterns by providing economic incentives through variable electricity prices. This paper explores the temporal flexibility of Danish households' electricity consumption through their participation in two smart grid projects: One is offering households to test an electric vehicle during five months and another is offering static time-of-use pricing. Based on qualitative interviews and hourly-recorded electricity metering data with families living in single-family detached homes, the paper shows that the combined trial influenced the households to time shift consumption from high-tariff to low-tariff hours in relation to three consumption areas: dishwashing, laundering and charging of electric vehicles. The analysis goes beyond this apparent flexibility and explores how time shifting of energy demand challenges the temporality of households' routinised everyday practices. The study recommends that future smart grid interventions acknowledge the temporal complexity and dynamics of interwoven social practices and how this affects the potential for time shifting energy demand. \u00a9 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.", "2016"]

However, it is still a challenging issue to cover uncertainties caused by intermittent renewable energy and random loads while optimizing multiple objectives in economy and environment. To tackle this issue, an integrated scheduling approach for MGs is proposed based on robust multi-objective optimization. Firstly, load shifting in a finite time is introduced to express an acceptable DR program for industrial customers. A minimax multi-objective optimization model is formulated to seek the minimum operation costs and emissions under the worst-case realization of uncertainties, which are captured by the robust sets with budgets of uncertainty. Secondly, a strong duality based model transformation method is implemented to cope with the strong coupling and nonlinearity in the proposed formulation. Also, Multi-Objective Cross Entropy (MOCE) algorithm is adopted to solve the reconstructed model for simultaneously optimizing all the objectives. Finally, detailed comparative experiments are conducted in problem level, model level and algorithm level. The simulation results show that the proposed scheduling approach can effectively attenuate the disturbances of uncertainties as well as achieve optimal economic and environmental benefits, compared with single-objective robust optimization scheduling approaches and deterministic multi-objective optimization scheduling approaches. Meanwhile, the validity and effectiveness of the robust multi-objective optimization approach for the MG integrated scheduling problem under uncertainty are confirmed. \u00a9 2017", "2017"]

The use of dynamic pricing strategies has emerged as a powerful DSM tool to optimize the energy consumption pattern of consumers and simultaneously improve the overall efficacy of the energy market. The main objective of the dynamic pricing strategy is to encourage consumers to participate in peak load reduction and obtain respective incentives in return. In this work, a game theory based dynamic pricing strategy is evaluated for Singapore electricity market, with focus on the residential and commercial sector. The proposed pricing model is tested with five load and price datasets to spread across all possible scenarios including weekdays, weekends, public holidays and the highest/lowest demand in the year. Three pricing strategies are evaluated and compared, namely, the half-hourly Real-Time Pricing (RTP), Time-of-Use (TOU) Pricing and Day-Night (DN) Pricing. The results demonstrate that RTP maximizes peak load reduction for the residential sector and commercial sector by 10% and 5%, respectively.

While most demand side management (DSM) models are limited to load shedding, as communications technology develops, using a DSM model that includes load shifting is becoming feasible. Our study focuses renewable energy management with a DSM model that contains two M/M/s queues: queue 1 for renewable and queue 2 for fossil-fired energy. As the queue length for renewable energy increases, new customers who had originally wanted renewable energy service may opt for fossil-fired energy service. Due to this behavior, having dependent M/M/s queues is more realistic than independent ones. The service provider can maximize profit by allocating server capacity and setting pricing for each kind of service. Besides, we propose a coordination policy: when there are m customers in the queue of renewable service and some fossil-fired energy servers are available, the service provider invite the first customer of the queue of the renewable energy service to be served in the fossil-fired energy server but the price charged to the customer will be the low price. Sharing resources between the two kinds of service can improve service system utilization, so as to benefit both the service provider and customers. \u00a9 2016", "2016"]

Flexibility options may help to integrate renewable electricity and reduce the need for electricity from fossil fuels. Load shifting is one of the flexibility options that lead to residual load smoothing in energy systems. In this paper, the effects of load shifting by dynamic electricity purchase on future residual load smoothing was assessed using wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in Germany as a case study. As dynamic electricity purchase is motivated economically, a consumer's demand for supplying flexibility options needs a price signal. Therefore, electricity wholesale prices on an hourly basis were modeled for 2030 using a merit order simulation for two scenarios. Relevant data for WWTPs was obtained from primary data suppliers, which was then aggregated. The effects on residual load smoothing were assessed by optimizing WWTPs electricity purchase costs on a daily basis. Our results show that German WWTPs have a potential to integrate 120\u00a0MWel of surplus electric power.

Demand Response (DR) and Demand Flexibility (DF) programs from buildings are well-adopted ancillary services to reduce the peak demand in grids by altering the power consumption strategy. Heating, Ventilation and Air-Conditioning (HVAC) systems are one of the largest energy demands in commercial buildings. In addition, HVAC systems are flexible to provide DR service to the grid. In this study, two common configuration topologies of building integration with Energy Storage Systems (ESS) and renewables are considered. A real-time optimization framework based on Model Predictive Control (MPC) is designed to control the power flow from the grid, solar Photovoltaic (PV) panels, and ESS to a commercial building with HVAC systems. The MPC framework uses the inherent thermal mass storage of the building and the ESS as a means to provide DR. Deterministic and probabilistic analysis are studied to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed framework on Building-to-Grid (B2G) systems. Our deterministic results show that the proposed optimization and control framework for B2G systems can significantly reduce the maximum load ramp-rate of the electric grid to prevent duck-curve problems associated with increase in solar PV penetration into the grid. Based on probabilistic results, even under prediction uncertainties, electricity cost saving and ramp-rate reduction is achievable. The results show that this DR service does not affect the building indoor climate in a way noticeable to humans and its effect on the operational building costs is reduced.

This has been often prompted by more stringent energy policy objectives aiming at reducing carbon emissions, phasing out nuclear plants and promoting overall energy efficiency, while containing both capital and operating costs. In this respect the energy hub concept has proven to be a popular approach for operating technologies and units comprising diversified energy carriers, small-scale production units, storage devices and converter systems. Additionally, developments in communication network and control infrastructure afford the possibility, at least in principle, to actively steer and adjust the load on the demand side of the energy balance, leading to the formulation of demand side management (DSM) techniques. This paper proposes an EM solution that combines the features and advantages of both of the aforementioned approaches, i.e. the energy hub framework and DSM methods. The key idea is to combine the supply-side characteristics of energy hubs with the demand side flexibility yielded by the deployment of DSM schemes. This combined approach is validated on an existing building complex by formalizing its energy supply system as an integrated hub and by modelling its heating demand based on thermodynamic principles. Numerical results based on this experimental setup are presented, illustrating that the combined approach can lead to overall savings typically exceeding 10% compared to a baseline scenario where no EM solution is applied, i.e. where only a rule-based heuristic is employed to control the available energy assets, and underscoring the advantages brought by a systematically integrated modelling and optimisation approach. The proposed solution is thus of interest for a broad host of installations in the residential and commercial domain, and for the latter a specific real-world example has been explicitly considered and analysed. The obtained results are encouraging and warrant further analysis and investigation. \u00a9 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.", "2016"]

In order to achieve an accurate model, the use of a probability density function to predict the wind speed and solar irradiance is proposed. On the other hand, in order to resolve the power produced from the wind and the solar renewable uncertainty of sources, the use of demand response programs with the participation of residential, commercial and industrial consumers is proposed. In this paper, we recommend the use of incentive-based payments as price offer packages in order to implement demand response programs. Results of the simulation are considered in three different cases for the optimization of operational costs and emissions with/without the involvement of demand response. The multi-objective particle swarm optimization method is utilized to solve this problem.

Nevertheless the existence of natural intermittency and fluctuations in PV generation incurs extra cost or service interruption in PV-based microgrids. The power generation of PV systems follows a natural schedule based on a sunny day. Similarly, the usage profiles in a microgrid are known from experience. When there is a mismatch in load or generation schedule, the system has to react to maintain a balance. In this work, both a centralized and a decentralized demand-responsive multi-agent control and management system are devised which include backup diesel generation and load curtailment. The latter affects user satisfaction. Wpose new realistic models to measure user satisfaction depending on the type of appliance curtailed. Our simulation shows that the inclusion of demand-side management lowers the cost of a mismatch even when user satisfaction is considered. Expectedly, the centralized implementation achieves a lower cost in more difficult conditions - when the peak consumption happens earlier than anticipated - but the decentralised approach provides acceptable cost levels when a centralized model cannot be implemented. \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Ltd", "2017"]

The reason for this is the intermittent nature of renewable energy, which is directly related to the problem of balancing the production and consumption of power within the power system. By using the DSM, the power consumption in the system comprising RES can be easier adjusted to the power production. The paper proposes an improved concept of DSM through the spatial and temporal DSM. The optimal spatial and temporal DSM aims at determining the power diagram of each individual load bus in order to achieve the optimal state in the whole system. The optimal state of the system can be quantified through the minimum daily energy losses or minimum daily operating costs. A mathematical definition of the optimal spatial and temporal DSM problem is presented as well as the algorithm for its solution. The proposed methodology has been tested by three test networks.

These contracts are supposed to encourage users to shift power consumption during peak hours to help balance the load in the power system. Of all the available contracts in Sweden, monthly-average price holds the largest share, in response to the low electricity prices during the last three years. It is not clear if RTP will become a popular dynamic pricing scheme since daily price fluctuations might keep customers away from this type of contract. Literature review suggests that RTP adoption is only beneficial when combined with the use of customer demand flexibility, but it does not provide enough information about users adopting RTP without changing their electricity usage profile. This paper studies the economic impact if customers would shift to RTP contracts without adopting demand-side management. To achieve this, electricity costs from a large group of households were calculated and compared between both pricing schemes using the hourly consumption data of a 7-year period. Results suggest that the RTP electricity contract offer a considerable economic savings potential even without enabling consumer demand-side management. \u00a9 2016 Elsevier Ltd.", "2016"]

At lower PV penetration levels, it is likely that the energy mix could under-supply utility demand, thus requiring extra units of generators, while at higher penetration levels it may oversupply demands, thus wasting generator capacity. Thus, determining the optimum installed capacity, technical limits, and economic benefits of large-scale PV systems are the main issues for both power utilities and decision makers. This study describes the development and validation of an alternative method (called the generation-demand matching model, GDMM) for evaluating the large-scale implementation of grid-connected PV power plants in Peninsular Malaysia relative to its interface with the traditional power grid system. The method explicitly provides a detailed assessment of the temporal and spatial factors that facilitate the match between PV generated electricity and electricity demand. These evaluation factors are analyzed using simulations of PV performance located at optimal sites. Optimal sites along with physical constraints were mapped using geographic information systems (GIS) for visualization and representation by location.

This allowed comparison of electricity generation with electricity demand to evaluate the impacts of increasing levels of PV penetration.

In developing countries, potable water supply is unreliable due to increasing demand, forcing end-users to seek alternative strategies such as pumping and storage in rooftop tanks to reliably meet their water demand. However, this is at an increased cost of energy cost.

The open loop optimal model is suitable in instances where only random disturbances due to measurement errors are present. However, in case the demand pattern changes for reasons such as occupancy change in the house, the closed-loop MPC model is suitable as it robustly minimizes the pumping cost while meeting the customer demand. Further, MPC proves its robustness as it is able to overcome the turnpike phenomenon. Each of these two models has their own strengths.

It is difficult for businesses which are tenants to adopt energy efficiency measures; thus, tariff switching is the easier option. Therefore, understanding the limits of the cost saving offered by tariff switching is an important step. This raises two questions: by how much could bills be reduced, and would all consumers benefit equally? Using a dataset of half-hourly electricity readings from more than 7500 British businesses, we performed an empirical analysis to discover which types of businesses might have lower or higher costs when changing between static and real-time tariffs. We identified differences in demand profiles that demonstrate that the decision whether to switch tariff types is a subtle one which may have a significant cost impact.

Our analytical methods can be used to distinguish the differences between typical electricity demand profiles for small- to medium-sized businesses and sectors in different market options.

Split incentives, where owners cannot benefit economically from energy cost savings for residences and resident investment in EERE is not feasible, have posed a significant barrier. A clean energy utility is posited to circumvent this barrier. This utility would be responsible for power purchase from the grid, ideally as a real-time purchase agent from the grid manager; investment in energy efficiency and renewable energy; and demand management through control of water heating, as well as supply-side management through deployment of stored solar at near-peak grid power purchase cost.

Considered in the analysis is a 2008 multifamily facility located in the Midwest of the U.S., with apartment level interval meters for both power and water. Historical data from these meters were used to assess the savings and demand-side management potential from investments in improved efficiency lighting, refrigeration, heat pumps, and water heaters, as well as investments in solar PV and storage for supply-side management.

This study is twofold; the first part proposes an energy management system that combines demand side management strategies with a view of minimizing the consumer's cost and reducing the power consumption from the grid. Appliance scheduling with a dedicated photovoltaic and storage system under time-of-use tariff shows that customers can realize cost savings and the power demanded from the grid is reduced by optimal scheduling of power sources. In the second part of this study, a model is developed to investigate the joint influence of price and CO2 emissions. It is found that CO2 emissions could give customers an environmental motivation to shift loads during peak hours, as it would enable co-optimization of electricity consumption costs and carbon emissions reductions. It is also demonstrated that the consumer's preferences on the cost sub-functions of energy, inconvenience and carbon emissions affects the consumption pattern. These results are important for both the consumer and the electricity suppliers, as they illustrate the optimal decisions considered in the presence of trade-offs between multiple objectives. A further study crucial to the consumer on economic analysis of PV and battery system showed that the consumer could recoup their initial investment within 5 years of their investment. \u00a9 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Cold energy storage technologies addressed are: Li-Ion batteries (Li-Ion EES), sensible heat thermal energy storage (SHTES); phase change material (PCM TES), compressed air energy storage (CAES) and liquid air energy storage (LAES). Batteries and CAES are electrical storage systems which run the cooling systems; SHTES and PCM TES are thermal storage systems which directly store cold energy; LAES is assessed as a hybrid storage system which provides both electricity (for cooling) and cold energy. A hybrid quantitative-qualitative comparison is presented. Quantitative comparison was investigated for different sizes of daily cooling energy demand and three different tariff scenarios. A techno-economic analysis was performed to show the suitability of the different storage systems at different scales. Three parameters were used (Pay-back period, Savings-per-energy-unit and levelized-cost-of-energy) to analyze and compare the different scenarios. The qualitative analysis was based on five comparison criteria (Complexity, Technology Readiness Level, Sustainability, Flexibility and Safety). Results showed the importance of weighing the pros and cons of each technology to select a suitable cold energy storage system. Techno-economic analysis highlighted the fundamental role of tariff scenario: a greater difference between peak and off-peak electricity tariff leads to a shorter payback period of each technology. \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Ltd", "2017"]

This issue is especially important from the point of view of improving the efficiency and reliability of the Polish EPSfor which purpose the aim is to reduce peak power by 1\u00a0GW, which represents about 4% of typically peak power value. Among the known methods of reduction of peak loads today, the tariff programs are commonly used; however, they do not achieve the desired results. With this in mind the article includes an assessment of the possibility of using a Decentralized Active Demand Response system for activities related to the reduction of peak loads. The article discusses the principle of operation of the DADR device in cooperation with thermostatic loads (fridge-freezer), in which there is a possibility to modify their characteristics of power versus time on the supply side. Analysis of the aggregated impact of the actions of such a solution on the daily load curve is shown in the simulation results. The simulation results have showed that the use of a DADR system involving thermostatic devices (fridgefreezers) available in Poland allows for a significant reduction in peak power of about 0.37\u00a0GW (1.6% of the targeted 4%) a reduction of energy consumption at peak hours of about 0.65 GWh and a shift to the night valley. The stochastic algorithm that was used reduced peak energy consumption without any negative impact on the electrical power system (there are no power overshoot and oscillations). It has also been shown that the new formula developed by the authors allows for calculation of the amount of reduced energy for various parameters of thermostatic devices and various durations of peak power. \u00a9 2016 Elsevier Ltd", "2017"]

In this research, a model-based optimal design method using genetic algorithm is developed to optimize the capacity of active CTES for maximizing the life-cycle cost saving including capital cost associated with storage capacity as well as incentives from both fast DR and PLM. In the method, the active CTES operates under a fast DR control strategy during DR events and under the storage-priority operation mode to shift peak demand during normal days. The optimal storage capacities, maximum annual net cost saving and corresponding power reduction set-points during DR events are obtained by using the proposed optimal design method.

Long term response models tend to underestimate short-term demand response when induced by prices. This has two important consequences. First, planning studies tend to undervalue DR and often overlook its benefits in utility demand management program development. Second, when DR is not overlooked, the open-loop DR control gain estimate may be too low. This can result in overuse of load resources, control instability and excessive price volatility. Our objective is therefore to develop a more accurate and better performing short-term demand response model. We construct the model from first principles about the nature of thermostatic load control and show that the resulting formulation corresponds exactly to the Random Utility Model employed in economics to study consumer choice. The model is tested against empirical data collected from field demonstration projects and is shown to perform better than alternative models commonly used to forecast demand in normal operating conditions. The results suggest that (1) existing utility tariffs appear to be inadequate to incentivize demand response, particularly in the presence of high renewables, and (2) existing load control systems run the risk of becoming unstable if utilities close the loop on real-time prices. \u00a9 2016 Elsevier Ltd", "2016"]

We find that differences in models' theoretical construct and assumptions can lead to divergences in their predictions about the consequences of U.S. shale gas boom. In general, models find that U.S. High Shale Gas scenario leads to increased U.S. production, lower global gas prices, and lower gas production in non-U.S. regions. Gas demand in Asia alone has little effects on U.S. production; but together with the shale gas boom, the U.S. can have a large export advantage. Overall, models find U.S. exports level range from 0.06 to 13.7 trillion cubic feet (TCF) in 2040.

First is how the demand shocks were implemented and how the model responds to shocks: static and elastic within each time period vs. endogenous to the long-term gross domestic product (GDP) growth.

This paper examines the pros and cons of strengthening demand-side options in strategies to reduce carbon emissions from the U.S. electricity sector. To date, demand-side management in the U.S. power sector has received overly simplistic treatment in energy models. To help fill this gap, we develop a customized version of the National Energy Modeling System to assess a range of demand- and supply-side policy scenarios. This enables four research hypotheses to be tested, related to mitigation costs, investment in new natural gas plants, carbon leakage, and local air pollution. We conclude that the clean power transformation can be made more affordable by improving the efficiency of energy utilization. By downscaling the expansion of natural gas plants, energy efficiency can also avoid legacy impacts. While strong energy-efficiency policies lower overall CO2 emissions, coal plant retirements can be delayed, postponing associated local air quality benefits.

On the other hand, it allows utilities to manage the aggregate consumption and predict load requirement. Unlike other pricing schemes, such as block tariff and time-of-use, the proposed pricing scheme can lower the energy bill of about 73% of customers, assuming that the total utility revenue is the same for all pricing schemes.

Here, we investigate what role DR could play to support system stability through fully remote-controlled (by the grid operator) shifts of individual processes in households and in the commercial and industrial sectors, testing the case of a high-renewables future in Germany. The grid operator is constrained by consumer acceptance of service interruptions, both in size and shift duration, and by technical boundaries. We find that DR has a large potential and is suited for short-term services such as spinning reserve or primary control and for damping residual load gradients. However, its potential is low for longer-term services like secondary/tertiary control or for satisfying residual load during low sun/wind times in a high-renewables future. We find that the potential for DR is not limited by the magnitude of shiftable capacity but by the maximum shift duration and the patterns of switching between positive and negative power demand, which makes DR useful for fast and short-term services but less useful for longer shifts. \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Ltd", "2017"]

To accomplish the low-carbon energy goal in the building sector, thermal energy storage offers a number of benefits by reducing energy consumption and promoting the use of renewable energy sources. This manuscript reviews recent advances in the development of thermal energy storage materials for building applications oriented towards zero energy buildings. Volumetric heat capacity of sensible, latent and thermochemical energy storage materials developed for low-to-moderate temperature applications are reviewed and assessed with a special focus on their technical characteristics and development stage. This encompasses most recent publications, international programmes and projects, and commercially available solutions. Physical, thermodynamic, kinetic and chemical properties are addressed, as well as costs. Advantages, drawbacks and challenges of the diverse alternatives are discussed. The analysis shows that solutions with the highest potential for competitive energy efficiency measures are based on latent and sensible energy storage systems, which present a volumetric thermal energy storage density up to 430 and 250\u00a0MJ/m3 respectively. Their applications in free-cooling ventilation systems, solar energy storage solutions for short and long-term storage periods, and demand-side management strategies towards the road to zero energy buildings are highlighted as promising, leading to a reduction of energy consumption of more than 30%.

EVs exhibit higher degree of charging flexibility when compared to other interruptible loads in buildings.

A mixed integer nonlinear programming model is formulated in GAMS and solved using Lindo optimizer. A case study in urban China is presented to verify the model and to identify opportunities for systems integration. Three scenarios are analyzed and the results show that a potential reduction in space heating and CO2 emissions of up to 57.7% and 50% are possible by retrofitting building envelopes with photovoltaics, ground source heat pump and natural gas cogeneration systems. Sensitivity analysis and multi-objective optimization further indicate that CO2 emission plays the most important role in decision-making. This approach enables to identify design trade-offs of complex urban energy systems so as to evaluate the potential of alternative technology mix. \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Ltd", "2017"]

So, nowadays in the power system scheduling, emission issue has been turned to be an important factor. In this paper, in addition to economic performance, emission problem of energy hub system has been also investigated. Therefore, a multi-objective optimization model has been proposed for cost-environmental operation of energy hub system in the presence of demand response program (DRP). Weighted sum approach has been employed to solve the proposed multi-objective model and fuzzy satisfying technique has been implemented to select the best compromise solution. Implementation of load management programs presented by DRP shifts some percentage of load from peak periods to off-peak periods to flatten load curve which leads to reduction of total cost and emission of energy hub system. A mixed-integer linear programming has been used to model the cost-environmental performance problem of energy hub system and then, GAMS optimization software has been utilized to solve it.

Different configurations are possible: B-R (gas boiler-resistance), HP-B (heat pump-gas boiler), and HP-R (heat pump-resistance) heaters.

We advance and complement this important field of energy research through an innovative methodology that characterises the energy consumption of domestic life by making the linkages between appliance end-use and activities through an ontology built from qualitative data about the household and NILM data.

Thus, besides strictly technical algorithmic approaches for processing quantitative smart meter data, we also draw on social science time use approaches and interview and ethnography data.

We then make inferences about activities occurring in the home by combining these disaggregated data with an ontology that formally specifies the relationships between electricity-using appliances and activities.

Heroic assumptions about future technology development are avoided by only including technology that is being deployed in large quantities (>10 Gigawatts per year), namely PV and wind.

The capacity value represents the contribution of a resource to generation adequacy and an understanding of this contribution is important to compare how different power system resources can assist power system operators and planners. Additionally, policy-makers and market operators need an appreciation of the capacity value of different resources in order to design capacity remuneration mechanisms.

The resource examined is electric thermal storage heating devices for space and water heating. Ireland is used as a test case. It was found that these load-shifting devices can provide an adequacy contribution to the power system and thus have a capacity value.

CCS is routinely identified as a key factor in least-cost transitions to a low-carbon electricity system in 2050, one with significant value by providing dispatchable and low-carbon electricity. This paper investigates production, demand and stability characteristics of the current and future electricity system. We analyse the Carbon Intensity (CI) of electricity systems composed of unabated thermal (coal and gas), abated (CCS), and wind power plants for different levels of wind availability with a view to quantifying the value to the system of different generation mixes. As a thought experiment we consider the supply side of a UK-sized electricity system and compare the effect of combining wind and CCS capacity with unabated thermal power plants. The resulting capacity mix, system cost and CI are used to highlight the importance of differentiating between intermittent and firm low-carbon power generators. We observe that, in the absence of energy storage or demand side management, the deployment of intermittent renewable capacity cannot significantly displace unabated thermal power, and consequently can achieve only moderate reductions in overall CI. A system deploying sufficient wind capacity to meet peak demand can reduce CI from 0.78 tCO2/MWh, a level according to unabated fossil power generation, to 0.38 tCO2/MWh. The deployment of CCS power plants displaces unabated thermal plants, and whilst it is more costly than unabated thermal plus wind, this system can achieve an overall CI of 0.1 tCO2/MWh. The need to evaluate CCS using a systemic perspective in order to appreciate its unique value is a core conclusion of this study. \u00a9 The Royal Society of Chemistry 2016.", "2016"]

Demand side management, together with thermal energy storage and renewable energy technologies, have mainly been studied so far at a building scale.

Using sample data collected from residential homes and consumer survey data located in Austin, TX, USA we show that the proposed integrated control and scheduling approach can minimize the peak load for the neighborhood by leveraging the physical differences and individual preferences between houses. On average, our framework is able to reduce the daily peak load for the group of houses by 25.5% (18.2 kW) when compared with the load for individually controlled thermostat settings and appliance start times. \u00a9 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Comparing program administrator cost with the total cost of saved energy can indicate the degree to which programs leverage investment by participants. Based on reported total costs and savings information for U.S. utility efficiency programs from 2009 to 2013, we estimate the savings-weighted average total cost of saved electricity across 20 states at 0.046 per kilowatt-hour (kW h), comparing favorably with energy supply costs and retail rates. Programs targeted on the residential market averaged 0.030 per kW h compared to 0.053 per kW h for non-residential programs. Lighting programs, with an average total cost of 0.018 per kW h, drove lower savings costs in the residential market. We provide estimates for the most common program types and find that program administrators and participants on average are splitting the costs of efficiency in half. More consistent, standardized and complete reporting on efficiency programs is needed. Differing definitions and quantification of costs, savings and savings lifetimes pose challenges for comparing program results.

Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) techniques provide this information by decomposing the aggregated electric load measured at the household level by a single-point smart meter into the individual contribution of each end-use. Despite being defined non-intrusive, NILM methods often require an intrusive data sampling process for training purpose. This calibration intrusiveness hampers NILM methods large-scale applications. Other NILM challenges are the limited accuracy in reproducing the end-use consumption patterns and their trajectories in time, which are key to characterize consumers\u2019 behaviors and appliances efficiency, and the poor performance when multiple appliances are simultaneously operated. In this paper we contribute a hybrid, computationally efficient, algorithm for NILM, called Hybrid Signature-based Iterative Disaggregation (HSID), based on the combination of Factorial Hidden Markov Models, which provide an initial approximation of the end-use trajectories, and Iterative Subsequence Dynamic Time Warping, which processes the end-use trajectories in order to match the typical power consumption pattern of each appliance. In order to deal with the challenges posed by intrusive training, a supervised version of the algorithm, requiring appliance-level measurements for calibration, and a semi-supervised version, retrieving appliance-level information from the aggregate smart-metered signal, are proposed. Both versions are demonstrated onto a real-world power consumption dataset comprising five different appliances potentially operated simultaneously. Results show that HSID is able to accurately disaggregate the power consumption measured from a single-point smart meter, thus providing a detailed characterization of the consumers\u2019 behavior in terms of power consumption. Numerical results also demonstrate that HSID is robust with respect to noisy signals and scalable to dataset including a large set of appliances. Finally, the algorithm can be successfully used in non-intrusive experiments without requiring appliance-level measurements, ultimately opening up new opportunities to foster the deployment of large-scale smart metering networks, as well as the design and practical implementation of personalized demand management strategies. \u00a9 2016 Elsevier Ltd", "2017"]

Here, a solar photo voltaic (SPV) system with pico hydro turbines (PHTs) and pump are used for minimizing the monthly electricity bill in a dynamic electricity pricing environment. Also, the available water in the open well is optimally used in order to minimize the residential electricity cost. In situations when either the price of the energy from the grid is low or when the available energy from the SPV system is in excess of the demand, the proposed model stores the energy in the form of gravitational potential energy of water in a reservoir. The stored energy is then retrieved using PHTs which feeds the load at the time when the energy price is high. The depth of the well is used as the working head for the operation of turbines and are optimally scheduled in order to minimize the water flow rate (WFR). The two fold objectives, i.e., minimizing the electricity cost and minimizing the WFR, is converted into a single objective function and is solved using particle swarm optimization (PSO).

Hence, in the energy efficiency and conservation field there is growing interest towards energy storage systems, especially when combined with the demand side management (DSM) concept, representing DSM the possibility of shaping end user electricity consumption. In this work an existing installation of a thermal energy storage (TES) system coupled with heat pumps in an industrial building is presented and a dynamic simulation model is built to represent its behaviour. Simulations are performed to show the load shifting potential of such storage and costs and energy use are assessed for different configurations, in order to evaluate the viability of this TES application. In particular the demand side strategy considered is aimed at shifting energy demand for cooling to weekend daytime to recover surplus PV electricity or otherwise to off peak hours to profit from lower electricity tariffs. It is found that the use of TES implies increased energy demand, while costs can decrease when electricity tariffs with a considerable difference between on peak and off peak rates are applied. Furthermore the integration with renewable sources for electricity production, such as PV panels, makes the installation of TES economically interesting independently of the electricity tariff in place.

We find these measures have contributed to moderating residential electricity demand growth but additional policy reform and tools are needed to increase their effectiveness and impact. Residential electricity demand is found to be price- and income- inelastic and tiered pricing alone may not be as effective in electricity conservation.

Those practices rely on Non-intrusive Appliance Load Monitoring (NIALM) methodologies. In this work an extension of NIALM to thermal loads is proposed: Non-intrusive Thermal Load Monitoring (NITLM). NIALM and NITLM share the same key point: a good model to calibrate loads. Thermal loads calibration is, at present, a task far from trivial. This paper addresses the set of measurements required to calibrate Building Energy Simulation (BES) models. This set is found by sensitivity analysis. Weather variables together with indoors air and surface temperatures form a complete set of non-intrusive measurements for free running BES calibration. Adding non-intrusive measurements such as indoors CO2concentration and door/window is required to validate BES under regular operation conditions. The proposed NITLM methodology validity is verified on two real-world buildings in different locations. From a complete year of measurements a BES model is validated and calibrated in both buildings for heating and cooling periods. Validity of the model is cross-checked by identifying thermal properties of the fabric and mechanical air exchange rate. Some NITLM applications are addressed and future work to extend NITLM applicability in real cases is pointed out. As example, simulation design hypothesis are checked for one building.

Optimization of energy supply systems usually considers energy demands as fixed constraints. Thereby, possible changes on the demand side are neglected. However, demand changes can lead to a better overall solution. Thus, DSM measures should be integrated into the optimization of energy systems. However, integrating optimization of DSM measures generally requires problem-specific process models. To avoid the need for problem-specific process models, we present a generic method applicable to various process domains. The method identifies a merit order of time steps with large potential for DSM and quantifies potential cost savings by DSM. Targets for demand-side measures are provided in a DSM map as guidance for the process engineer. The merits of the novel method are illustrated for an industrial case study. In this study, 9.6% of all time steps are promising for DSM measures since they show a high sensitivity to demand changes.

The smart control of demand is able to contribute to the balance by providing the grid frequency response. This paper uses the industrial Melting Pot (MP) loads as an example. A thermodynamic model depicting the physical characteristics of MPs was firstly developed based on field measurements carried out by Open Energi. A distributed control was applied to each MP which dynamically changes the aggregated power consumption of MPs in proportion to changes in grid frequency while maintaining the primary heating function of each MP. An aggregation of individual MP models equipped with the control was integrated with the Great Britain (GB) power system models. Case studies verified that the aggregated MPs are able to provide frequency response to the power system.

We adopt approximate dynamic programming to schedule the operation of different types of appliances including must-run and controllable appliances. We assume that users can sell their excess power generation to other users or to the utility company. Since it is more profitable for users to trade energy with other users locally, users with excess generation compete with each other to sell their respective extra power to their neighbors. A game theoretic approach is adopted to model the interaction between users with excess generation. In our system model, each user aims to obtain a larger share of the market and to maximize its revenue by appropriately selecting its offered price and generation. In addition to yielding a higher revenue, consuming the excess generation locally reduces the reverse power flow, which impacts the stability of the system. Simulation results show that our proposed algorithm reduces the energy expenses of the users.

To achieve the goal, TOU and D-TOU tariffs are modeled and the TES system equipment capacities and operation with cooling and heating tanks are optimized based on particle swarm optimization for an industrial building load. The results for various pricing scenarios show that D-TOU tariff can be beneficial to the utility company and customer, as peak loads for electricity in day types 1, 2, 3 and 4 are reduced by 54, 52, 47 and 44% and customer costs for electricity cooling are lowered by 14, 13, 11 and 8%. \u00a9 2016 Elsevier B.V.", "2016"]

Electricity, which is the most flexible and manageable energy form, is currently used in a variety of activities and applications. For instance, electricity is used for heating, cooling, lighting, and for operating electronic appliances and electric vehicles. Nowadays, given the rapid development and commercialization of technologies and devices that rely on electricity, electricity demand is increasing faster than overall primary energy supply. Consequently, the design and planning of power systems is becoming a progressively more important issue in order to provide affordable, reliable and sustainable energy in timely fashion, not only in developed countries but particularly in developing economies where electricity demand is increasing even faster.Power systems are networks of electrical devices, such as power plants, transformers, and transmission lines, used to produce, transmit, and supply electricity. The design and planning of such systems require the selection of generation technologies, along with the capacity, location, and timing of generation and transmission capacity expansions to meet electricity demand over a long-term horizon. This manuscript presents a comprehensive optimization framework for the design and planning of interconnected power systems, including the integration of generation and transmission capacity expansion planning. The proposed framework also considers renewable energies, carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) technologies, demand-side management (DSM), as well as reserve and CO2 emission constraints. The novelty of this framework relies on an integrated assessment of the aforementioned features, which can reveal possible interactions and synergies within the power system. Moreover, the capabilities of the proposed framework are demonstrated using a suite of case studies inspired by a real-world power system, including \"business as usual\" and \"CO2 mitigation policy\" scenarios. These case studies illustrated the adaptability and effectiveness of the framework at dealing with typical situations that can arise in designing and planning power systems. \u00a9 2016 Elsevier Ltd.", "2016"]

A novel parametrization approach dealing with the weekday dependent variations of EV demand is introduced. Investigating a broad interval of CO2 prices yields robustness against varying merit order curves. The underlying nonlinear relationship leads to qualitatively different impacts of EVs on power plant dispatch at different CO2 prices. Furthermore, we find that curtailment of renewable energy sources is reduced independently of the charging strategy. Concerning system cost and emissions, the charging strategy vehicle-to-grid proves to be most beneficial.

The objective is to actively engage customers in network planning and operation for reducing network costs and finally their electricity bills. System congestion costs are quantified according to generation and load curtailment by assessing their contribution to network congestion. Plus, network investment cost is quantified through examining the needed investment for resolving system congestion. Customers located at various might face the same energy signals but they are differentiated by network cost signals. Once customers conduct DR during system congested periods, the smaller savings from investment and congestion cost are considered as the economic singles for rewarding the response. The innovation is that the method translates network congestion/investment costs into tariffs, where current research is mainly focused on linking customer response to energy prices. A typical UK distribution network is utilised to illustrate the new approach and results show that derived economic signals can effectively benefit end customers for reducing system congestion costs and deferring required network investment. \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Ltd", "2017"]

Responsiveness of the market participants can improve reliability of system operation as well as capital cost investments. In this regard, the accurate forecast of electricity price and demand in smart grids is an important challenge as their strong correlation makes a separate forecasting to be ineffective. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel hybrid algorithm for simultaneous forecast of price and demand that uses a set of effective tools in preprocessing part, forecast engine and tuned algorithm. To highlight our contributions, the proposed forecast algorithm classified into three main parts.

The SWIS is isolated from other grids and currently has no available hydropower. Hence it makes a good case study of how supply and demand might be balanced on an hour-by-hour basis and grid stability maintained without the benefit of energy import/export or pumped hydroelectric storage. The tool included regional models for wind and solar power, so that hypothetical power stations were not confined to sites with existing wind farms or solar power stations, or sites with measurements of wind speed and solar radiation. A generic model for solar thermal storage and simple models for energy efficiency, distributed battery storage and power to gas storage were also developed. Due to the urgency of climate change mitigation a rapid construction schedule of completion by 2030, rather than the more common target of 2050, was set. A scenario with high wind generation, and scenarios with varying levels of solar power, wind power, distributed battery storage, energy efficiency improvements and power to gas systems were considered. The battery storage system and PV arrays were configured to provide synthetic inertia to maintain grid stability (with a small loss in capacity for each), and existing synchronous generators were kept spinning with no fuel input, adding a small increase to the electrical load demand. The level of synthetic inertia provided by battery storage was estimated for each scenario. The results indicated that a balanced mix of solar PV, solar thermal, efficiency, and storage were the most feasible to be built on a rapid time scale. The required capacity and build rate of the generation and storage systems would be reduced if energy efficiency improvements were implemented on a more rapid schedule compared to the current global improvement rate. The scenario with very high levels of wind power (\u223c80% generation) were found to be capable of meeting SWIS reliability criteria if very large amounts of distributed storage or some high capacity seasonal reserve generation system such as power to gas were present. High levels of battery storage capacity and efficiency improvement could be as effective as a power to gas system.

Two residential buildings with different levels of insulation and air-tightness have been modelled. This wide range of thermal properties covers the global performance of the residential building stock, and does not only focus on state-of-the-art buildings.

Besides, the existing power grids are getting smarter by implementing the new generation of information technologies and communication systems. In smart grid, the electricity suppliers can modify the customers' electrical load consumption by employing appropriate scheduling schemes such as DR (demand response) programs. In this paper, we consider the S. E. Hubs (smart energy hubs) framework, in which the customers can use EMS (energy management system) to access to the electricity and natural gas prices data and wisely manage their daily energy consumption. We extend the existing DR programs to the IDR (integrated demand response) programs with the aim of modifying both electricity and natural gas consumption on the customer side. The interaction between S.E. hubs in the IDR program is formulated as a non-cooperative game. The goal of the IDR game is to maximize the natural gas and electricity utility companies' profit and to minimize the customers' consumption cost. It is shown that the proposed game model is an ordinal potential game with unique Nash equilibrium. Simulations are performed on an energy system with 6 S. E. Hubs, one electricity utility, and one natural gas utility companies. The results confirm that the IDR program can benefit both the customer side, by reducing the electricity and gas consumption cost, and the supplier side, by reducing the peak load demand in the electricity and natural gas load profiles. \u00a9 2015 Elsevier Ltd.", "2015"]

Charging of such vehicles is typically done at home from a standard outlet or at corporate car locations and thus adds extra load on the distribution grid. Due to high power consumption of PEV charging, the utility industries face enormous challenges to provide this extra demand. The identification of charging patterns of PEV is thus of paramount importance to balance the electric load and assure coordinated charging. More specifically, there is a need to identify users with PEVs to better manage the load distribution. In the present research, an analysis based on energy envelopes of the usage patterns is performed.

Besides consuming electricity increasingly produced by renewable energies, heat pumps can also have an important role to balance supply and demand, allowing the integration of intermittent renewable generation in smart grids. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate that ground source heat pumps are a very high efficiency technology for buildings space conditioning, and present a high potential for electric load management as a flexible load, when combined with the thermal storage capacity of the building. The very high efficiency of an advanced ground source heat pump system, which integrates state of art components in an optimal manner, was assessed considering the seasonal performance factors for one complete heating season and one complete cooling season, calculated based on the monitored data of an experimental site installed in a service building in Portugal. Innovative load management strategies to control the heat pump coupled with the thermal mass of the building were tested and its associated benefits, including integration for intermittent generation, were evaluated.

Steam condensation in the power generation cycle creates a need for cooling, often accomplished using large amounts of water. These large water requirements can lead to negative consequences of power plants dialing down or shutting down during times of low water availability. Consequently, water constraints can translate into energy constraints. Projected future population growth and changing climate conditions might also increase the competition for water in many areas, motivating a resource accounting analysis to both establish a baseline of current water requirements and simulate possible impacts from future water and energy management decisions. Our analysis of the current water demands for power generation, focused on the state of Illinois, combined existing digital spatial datasets with engineering basic principles to synthesize a geographic information systems (GIS) model of current and projected water demand for thermoelectric power plants. We evaluated two potential future cases based on water use implications: (1) a shift in fuel from coal to natural gas, and (2) a shift in cooling technology from open-loop to closed-loop cooling. Our results show that a shift from coal-generated to natural gas-generated electricity could decrease statewide water consumption by 0.10billionm3/yr (32% decrease) and withdrawal by 7.9billionm3/yr (37% decrease), on average. A shift from open-loop to closed-loop cooling technologies could decrease withdrawals by an average of 21billionm3/yr (96% decrease), with the tradeoff of increasing statewide water consumption for power generation by 0.18billionm3/yr (58% increase). Furthermore, we performed an economic analysis of retrofitting open-loop cooling systems to closed-loop cooling, revealing an annual cost between $0.58 and $1.3billion to retrofit the 22 open-loop cooling plants considered, translating to an effective water price between $0.03 and $0.06/m3.

These fluctuations can be faced with flexible consumption through Demand Side Management (DSM), establishment of further centralized storage capacities and provisioning of dynamic back up generation capacities. At least the latter two options can impose large establishment and operation costs upon the electricity market. Therefore, the feasibility and the resulting potential of coupling the electricity grid with the thermal supply of residential buildings is analysed in this paper. Thereby, inexpensive and widespread thermal storage capacities could be used to improve the integration of dynamic renewable electricity generation. In this paper the technical and economical key impact factors for such thermal DSM approach are elaborated. Based on a literature review, the identified key factors are aggregated to form consistent scenarios of the German \"Energiewende\" (turnaround in energy policy). The practicability and possible magnitude of the intended DSM is then analysed based on the identified scenarios. All resulting scenarios highlight the growing demand for a flexible electricity market. Especially in scenarios with strong growth of renewable electricity generation, up to 45 GW of flexible electric capacities would be required in Germany by the year 2030. Furthermore, the analysis demonstrates that independently of the energy market development, it is very likely that electricity coupled supply systems will continuously have installed capacities of at least 14 GW. It is found that especially the strong dissemination of smart metering and smart control infrastructure is crucial to incorporate these capacities into DSM activities.

The partial and temporal influences on energy demand in each country of the number of households, floor area per household (m2) and unit consumption for space and water heating (kWh/m2/year) are disaggregated. The long-run price elasticity of demand at the unit consumption level is found to be low (around -0.25 over the four countries) while the long-run income elasticity of floor area per household is found to be around 0.25 for Italy, Sweden and the UK but insignificant for France. In an exercise using the model to estimate demand to 2050 under annual increases in energy prices of between 0% and 3% it is found that non-price effects such as building codes and autonomous technical progress (represented in the model as a time trend) are equally or more important than the price effect in reducing demand.

This controller consisted of an ice bank model, an air temperature forecast model and an optimisation algorithm. The financial and grid utilisation benefits produced by implementation of this controller over the current state of the art in ice bank load shifting control was tested in a day ahead real time electricity pricing forecast environment. This hypothetical real time electricity price was based on the cost of electricity in the Irish wholesale market. Multiple ice bank charge levels were simulated in order to quantity the performance of two control methods for varying operating conditions. First, the \"standard controller\" was based on the current modus operandi for ice bank systems where Ice was generated for food cooling at night when the off-peak electricity tariff is available (00:00-08:00. h). Second, the \"upgraded controller\" was developed as a bespoke Demand Side Management control system for food refrigeration in a future electricity pricing environment. It consisted of a dual function load shifting optimisation algorithm, an ice bank model, and a predictive air temperature model. A preliminary study was also carried out to test the robustness of the controller's performance in an uncertain real time electricity pricing forecast scenario. Both economic and grid management benefits were found by simulating the operation of the cold thermal storage load shifting controller in a forecasted day ahead real time electricity pricing environment. The energy savings achieved for 100% ice bank charge were low, but as the desired charge level was reduced to 75%, 50% and 25% the savings potential increased. The introduction of uncertain real time electricity pricing forecasts nullified any cost savings made by the load-shifting controller in comparison to the current state of the art. \u00a9 2015 Elsevier Ltd.", "2015"]

Self-consumption can be defined as the share of the total PV production directly consumed by the PV system owner. With decreased subsidies for PV electricity in several countries, increased self-consumption could raise the profit of PV systems and lower the stress on the electricity distribution grid. This review paper summarizes existing research on PV self-consumption and options to improve it. Two options for increased self-consumption are included, namely energy storage and load management, also called demand side management (DSM). Most of the papers examine PV-battery systems, sometimes combined with DSM. The results show that it is possible to increase the relative self-consumption by 13-24% points with a battery storage capacity of 0.5-1. kW. h per installed kW PV power and between 2% and 15% points with DSM, both compared to the original rate of self-consumption.

Over the past few years, the environmental issues have become a society concern and the Clean Air Act Amendments passage the laws indicating the need for renewable resources promotion. Multifarious incentive-based support schemes have been designed to increase the penetration rate of the renewables in power generation. In this context, open questions remain regarding the financial resources of the support schemes. This paper addresses the impacts of Feed-In-Tariff (FIT) mechanism on the social welfare in an integrated renewable-conventional GEP framework, while consumers are considered for patronizing the financial burden of FIT (s{cyrillic}FIT). Hence, after applying the gravitational search algorithm to a multistage GEP model, the benefit of generation company (GENCO) and consumer surplus are both determined as the social welfare terms. The virtual price criterion is also introduced to evaluate the effect of FIT expenditure on consumers' surplus.

Real-time electricity markets (RTM) are the non-discriminatory transaction platforms for providing necessary balancing services, where the market clearing (nodal or zonal prices depending on markets) is very close to real time operations of power systems. One of the primary functions of RTMs in modern power systems is establishing an efficient and effective mechanism for small DER and DR to participate in balancing market transactions, while handling their meteorological or intermittent characteristics, facilitating asset utilization, and stimulating their active responses. Consequently, RTMs are dedicated to maintaining the flexibility and reliability of power systems. This paper reviews advanced typical RTMs respectively in the North America, Australia and Europe, focusing on their market architectures and incentive policies for integrating DER and DR in electricity markets. In this paper, RTMs are classified into three groups: Group I applies nodal prices implemented by optimal power flow, which clears energy prices every 5. min. Group II applies zonal prices, with the time resolution of 5-min. Group III is a general balancing market, which clears zonal prices intro-hourly. The various successful advanced RTM experiences have been summarized and discussed, which provides a technical overview of the present RTMs integrating DER and DR. \u00a9 2014 Elsevier Ltd.", "2015"]

However, the volatility of the real-time market clearing price raises a price risk issue because the load serving entity sells electricity to customers at a relatively frozen retail rate. One method to hedge price risk is to implement various dynamic pricing schemes in the retail sector in order to reflect the volatility of the real-time market clearing price to the retail rate. This paper presents several analyses for designing one such pricing scheme, namely critical peak pricing for a profit-maximizing load serving entity. Specifically, how the parameters of critical peak pricing affect profit based on the price responsiveness model of customers is analyzed. In this process, a method for solving the events scheduling problem is used as a tool for the analyses. Furthermore, we offer intuitive guidelines and rules for selecting those parameters that maximize the profit of the load serving entity.

The results show that the power demand reduction and building indoor temperature during the DR event can be predicted accurately. The power demand reduction is stable which is more predictable for the grid management. The building indoor temperature rise is restrained and indoor thermal comfort is improved through use of a small scale active storage system during the DR event.

Because wind power is regarded as a promising renewable energy, how to increase its production and reduce energy and water costs has attracted many attentions. However, there is a lack of comprehension of the energy-water nexus in wind power generation systems. In this study, we developed a new energy-water nexus analysis framework for wind power generation systems, which includes both element and pathway nexus analyses. In element nexus analysis, energy used for water extraction and wastewater treatment and water consumed for electricity generation were investigated. The mutual interactions and control situations within the wind power generation system were also examined in pathway nexus analysis based on Network Environ Analysis (NEA). Taking a typical wind power generation system in China as the case, the element nexus analysis results show that water consumptions per unit of wind power generation are much lower than those of the other power generation systems. Energy consumption of the water system in the wind power generation system is 3.395 \u00d7 107 MJ, of which water extraction process constitutes 90.22%. In pathway nexus analysis, network utility analysis and network control analysis are performed to investigate the dominant sectors and pathways for energy-water circulation and the mutual relationships between pairwise components of the wind power generation system. The results of network utility analysis show that compartment of surface water and groundwater (WA) is beneficiary from waste treatment (WT), which implies that although extra energy is devoted to WT, the benefit of water recycling is larger than energy cost. The results of network control analysis indicate that on-grid power (PG) not only depends on direct wind resource input (WI) (with a dependence coefficient of 0.20), but also indirectly supported by major compartments of fossil fuel input (FU) (0.16), construction material input (CO) (0.14), and wind turbines manufactory (MA) (0.12).

One possibly promising group of demand side technologies in terms of ADR are electric heating systems. These systems could allow to modify their electrical load pattern without affecting the final, thermal energy service they deliver, thanks to the thermal inertia in the system. One of the major remaining obstacles for a large scale roll-out of ADR schemes is the lack of a thorough understanding of interactions between the demand and supply side of the electric power system and the related possible benefits for consumers and producers. Therefore, in this paper, an integrated system model of the electric power system, including electric heating systems (heat pumps and auxiliary resistance heaters) subjected to an ADR scheme, is developed, taking into account the dynamics and constraints on both the supply and demand side of the electric power system.

Time-of-use pricing is very popular with economists, and many researchers have been written estimating and exploring the optimal time-of-use pricing for electricity markets. Yet, such pricing has rarely been used in the natural gas sector. In this paper, we propose an optimal time-of-use pricing in urban gas market based on an evolutionary game-theoretic perspective. As the urban gas market is a nonlinear complex economic system with several interacting agents, we use a multi-agent system comprising a government agent, a local gas distribution operator agent, and different types of end-user agents. A power structure demand response program is employed to simulate the user demand response. A mixed-integer linear programming is formulated to determine the time-of-use price-signal delivering maximum gas operator profit and the optimal load pattern for end-users. In an illustrative example, we simulate and compare the time-of-use block prices and time-of-use hourly prices with traditional fixed pricing using real-world data of Wuhan in China. The numerical results indicate that time-of-use pricing schedules have significant potential for peak-shaving and load-shifting for urban gas pipeline network systems and would thus lower operating costs. Furthermore, different gas users exhibit different demand responsiveness intensity. Finally, we evaluate the impact on total social welfare of regulation scenarios and find that welfare decreases with deregulation, implying that the urban gas market is immature and reasonable regulation is still necessary. \u00a9 2015 Elsevier Ltd.", "2016"]

One way of meeting this challenge is to adjust the momentary electricity demand to the electricity supply via demand response (DR) measures. During recent years, a massive body of model-based assessments has been used to address various aspects of this option. However, the extent to which the existing models are able to provide holistic and satisfying answers is debatable. Thus, the aim of this study is to describe the state-of-the-art research, identify gaps and provide recommendations for future model developments. For this purpose, we analyse 117 publications which develop DR models. We cluster these publications according to their content and provide a systematically structured review. The literature review primarily reveals that the majority of models assess the extent to which single aspects, such as DR pricing schemes or load adjustment of individual end-uses, affect the overall electricity system in terms of peak load reduction and RES integration. The model-based assessments, however, are often restricted to two major pricing schemes (real-time pricing and time-of-use pricing) and end-uses from the residential sector. In addition, from a technical point of view, the temporal resolution rarely exceeds one hour and the scope of the studies hardly extends beyond the borders of individual countries, ignoring system interactions through transnational interconnections. The results of the review suggest that the first step to improve DR models would be to overcome the shortcomings identified. However, in order to holistically assess the potential contribution of DR to the integration of RES, a new model concept is required. Such a model needs to simulate the load adjustment of individual end-uses, considering their techno-economic constraints, under varying DR schemes, and extrapolate the cumulative impacts on the electricity system. \u00a9 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

On the future of Germany\u2019s power market design; Abstract: Although the objectives of the Energiewende (energy transition) are broadly accepted in Germany, the practical ways of achieving them remain highly contentious. In particular, the question of whether and how security of supply can be guaranteed over the course of this profound transformation of the energy system is currently the subject of controversy in the scientific and public debate. Recently, calls for additional payments to power plant operators for providing generation capacity have grown increasingly loud. But the introduction of capacity payments of this sort could have far-reaching consequences for the future organisation of Germany\u2019s electricity supply. Therefore, the political decision on this issue - which is scheduled for this year - should not be made without a sound scientific analysis.; Basically, measures aimed at guaranteeing security of supply must address the possible causes of capacity shortages as broadly as possible. When designing such measures, besides security of supply, additional objectives such as cost-effectiveness and the environmental and social acceptability of electricity supply should also be taken into account. Capacity payments only partially meet these requirements. Moreover, once introduced, they are difficult to adapt, or revise even, to suit changing framework conditions. This is particularly problematic in view of the current lack of clear evidence for future security of supply problems. Therefore, introducing capacity payments at this point in time would not appear to be constructive. It would make more sense to introduce instead a mix of measures which would strengthen the electricity market, create conditions for feeding in electricity from renewable energy sources as and when required, and set incentives for the expansion of grid capacity, storage systems and demand side management. Should security of supply still appear uncertain under these changed framework conditions, the introduction of a strategic reserve, which would be held by the regulatory authority or the transmission system operator, is recommended - not, however, the creation of an entirely new, additional market segment in the form of a capacity market. \u00a9 2015, Lehmann et al.; licensee Springer.", "2015"]

The proposed approach estimates the hourly DHW load, and proposes and simulates different DR (demand response) strategies, from the supply side, to minimize the dispatch costs of an energy system. The case study consists on optimizing the electricity load, in a representative day with low solar radiation, in Corvo Island, Azores. The DHW backup is induced by three different demand patterns. The study compares different DR strategies: backup at demand (no strategy), pre-scheduled backup using two different imposed schedules, a strategy based on linear programming, and finally two strategies using genetic algorithms, with different formulations for DHW backup - one that assigns number of systems and another that assigns energy demand. It is concluded that pre-determined DR strategies may increase the generation costs, but DR strategies based on optimization algorithms are able to decrease generation costs. In particular, linear programming is the strategy that presents the lowest increase on dispatch costs, but the strategy based on genetic algorithms is the one that best minimizes both daily operation costs and total energy demand, of the system. \u00a9 2015 Elsevier Ltd.", "2015"]

Electricity resources are allocated based on demand, priority, fairness, the available electrical resources, and the budget, so that even when the unit price is high (i.e., the available resources are restricted), higher-priority devices continue to operate without interruption. When the price falls, resources are distributed to satisfy the requirements of a larger number of devices. We include ESSs (energy storage systems) in the algorithm to reserve energy during low-price times for use during high-price times.

Although they could be powered by renewable energy produced on-site, technical and economic factors make that difficult. Moreover, the seasonal nature of demand requires an oversizing of energy generation and/or storage, increasing system costs. In this paper, we sought renewable energy systems that were economically optimal. We focused on six farming facility case studies to find the optimal energy generation solution using a simulation and optimization tool based on genetic algorithms. Photovoltaic-diesel hybrids and diesel systems were found to be optimal, with energy costs from 0.13 to 1.08\u20ac/kWh and from 0.32 to 0.52\u20ac/kWh, respectively. The strong effect of demand management was an interesting finding, as it may indicate significant system size and cost reductions. In addition, the optimum photovoltaic fixed tilt angles depended not only on the seasonal profile of the demand, but also on the pumping schedule. Although the difference between market interest rates and the rise of fuel prices strongly influences the advantage of incorporating, or not, renewable generation, this study supports that hybrid photovoltaic-diesel systems can make profitable use of renewable energy in drip irrigation. \u00a9 2014 Elsevier Ltd.", "2015"]

The management of power flow aims to minimize electricity cost subject to a number of constraints, such as power balance, solar output and battery capacity. With respect to demand side management, an optimal control method (open loop) is developed to schedule the power flow of hybrid system over 24. h, and model predictive control is used as a closed-loop method to dispatch the power flow in real-time when uncertain disturbances occur.

Existing methods often rely on accurate predictions or knowledge of the future demand, and most require a bi-directional communication infrastructure. This paper proposes two novel demand management approaches that do not have either of these requirements. The demand management problem is formulated as a constrained optimization problem to meet end-user energy demand subject to the physical limits of the electrical network. The adopted model focuses on the last mile of distribution networks and accounts for transformer load, line load and phase unbalance limitations. The optimization problem is solved iteratively, in a distributed and computationally tractable manner. In the first method, the behaviour of all users is coordinated through a time-varying price signal (a virtual price) that reflects how much power can be distributed given the network constraints. This virtual price signal is broadcast to all end-users by the Distribution Service Operator through a passive uni-directional communication channel. In the second method, an algorithm local to the user approximates the state of congestion in the network using the historical local voltage measurements. This method does not require a communication infrastructure. The performance of both methods is compared and their resulting behaviours are illustrated using a realistic simulation relevant to a typical Australian suburban low voltage distribution network. \u00a9 2015 Elsevier Ltd.", "2015"]

This control is a new strategy that compensates the global power flow of a distributed generation system. In fact, using the DSM strategy, the renewable energy can be used effectively to satisfy the demand and reduce the size of the system components. It leads to satisfy customers' continuous requirements to minimize the loss of power supply propability (LPSP), to extend the battery life time minimizing the storage system charge cycle, and to reduce fuel consumption and CO2 emission together with the diesel generator operation rate (DGOR). Consequently, the DSM strategy is implemented to ensure the minimum system cost. The DSM algorithm relies on the customer's energy consumption record, the instantaneous available PV energy and the state of charge (SOC) of the battery storage system. This could be achieved through switching between two action modes on the consumption profile: time shifting load mode, amplitude modulation load mode. To prove the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy, two scenarios were investigated. The first one describes the system's simulation for two typical days.

The objective of this study is to explore whether dynamic facade technologies can play an enabling role in supporting a desired level of electricity service at either minimum operating cost or minimum carbon footprint through optimized integrated control with distributed energy resources.

In response, the EU issued Directive (2006/32/EC) on energy end-use efficiency and energy services (ESD) to motivate energy companies to promote energy efficiency and conservation, closely followed by Directive (2012/27/EU) on energy efficiency (EED), requiring the setting up energy efficiency obligation schemes.

We approach the problem of an aggregator bidding into the day-ahead electricity market with the objective of minimizing charging costs while satisfying the PEVs' flexible demand. The aggregator places demand bids only (no vehicle-to-grid is considered). The aggregator is assumed to potentially influence market prices, in contrast to what is commonly found in the literature. Specifically, the bidding strategy of the aggregator is formulated as a bilevel problem, which is implemented as a mixed-integer linear program. The upper level problem represents the charging cost minimization of the aggregator, whereas the lower level problem represents the market clearing. Since the bids of other market participants are not known to the aggregator ex ante, a simple strategy is used to estimate them, based on historical data. An aggregated representation of the PEV end-use requirements as a virtual battery, with time varying power and energy constraints, is proposed, derived from individual driving patterns. Since driving patterns cannot be perfectly forecasted, we introduce a probabilistic virtual battery model. We compare the results of the proposed bidding strategy with those of a bidding strategy assuming exogenous prices, uncontrolled charging, and a central dispatch of the fleet. We also explore the impacts of different sources of uncertainty. Results show that with the proposed bidding strategy, costs are significantly lower than under inflexible charging and are lower than assuming exogenous prices.

We find that the impact on the load duration curve strongly differs between charging modes. In a fully user-driven mode, charging largely occurs during daytime and in the evening, when power demand is already high. User-driven charging may thus have to be restricted because of generation adequacy concerns. In contrast, cost-driven charging is carried out during night-time and at times of high PV availability. Using a novel model formulation that allows for simulating intermediate charging modes, we show that even a slight relaxation of fully user-driven charging results in much smoother load profiles. Further, cost-driven EV charging strongly increases the utilization of hard coal and lignite plants in 2030, whereas additional power in the user-driven mode is predominantly generated from natural gas and hard coal. Specific CO2 emissions of EVs are substantially higher than those of the overall power system, and highest under cost-driven charging.

This reverse power flow causes the voltage rise problem. In this paper, we study the use of demand side management to mitigate the voltage rise problem. We propose an autonomous energy consumption scheduling algorithm, which schedules the operation of deferrable loads to jointly shave the peak load and reduce the reverse power flow. The proposed algorithm shifts the operation of deferrable loads from peak consumption hours to hours with high-power generation from the PV units. We use stochastic programming to formulate an energy consumption scheduling problem, which takes into account the uncertainty related to the amount of power generation from PV units. The formulated cost function comprises a monetary cost for energy consumption, the revenue from energy export, and an external cost for the voltage rise. Numerical results show that our proposed algorithm can mitigate the voltage rise problem in areas with high penetration of PV units and reduce the peak-to-average ratio of the aggregate load. \u00a9 2016 IEEE.", "2016"]

Custom-coded in-home displays (IHDs) were created to provide real-time household electricity consumption feedback, and were framed as either (a) simple kW consumption, or (b) kW consumption and the corresponding cost, or (c) kW consumption and a dynamically-derived social normative frame. Analyses focused on household electricity consumption in the first week following deployment, and again over a 3-month time span. Findings showed that households receiving simple feedback, and feedback framed as cost did not differ significantly from the randomized control at either the 1-week or the 3-month time points. Similarly, results showed that educational materials alone did not reduce electricity consumption. However, significant effects were found for households receiving the normative frame, which consumed 9% less than control households during the initial 1-week evaluation period, and 7% less during the full 3-month evaluation period. Yet despite these findings, residents reported more positive experiences and more obligations to conserve electricity with the cost and feedback IHDs.

This study explores current and potential energy behavioural adaptations in Portugal during the smart grid transition process. A web-based survey was made to a representative sample of a specific segment of Portuguese residential end-users. The survey evaluated current energy behaviours and hypothetical future behaviours in a dynamic pricing scenario. Results show this population segment has a positive predisposition towards smart technologies and demand shifting, but it is less likely to accept load control and switch to the liberalised energy market. Factors influencing the behavioural potential are mostly related with market regulation, households' practices and usage behaviours, interference with the private domain, information and technical aspects, and social values. To facilitate behavioural adaptations several strategies are recommended, such as improving the energy market regulation, assessing households' behaviours, prioritising actions already embedded in households daily routines, not interfering with their activities and ensure an override option, and improving energy services, trust and information provided to end-users.

A fully mixed thermal model of the water heater is used to formulate the optimization problem as a binary integer program, whereas a multi-layer model is used to simulate actual system behavior. The current approach requires only one-way communication of a pseudo cost function, which may depend upon factors such as expected electricity prices, local grid load, and expected renewable electricity production. An optimal heating strategy is then determined on-site based on the expected demand and the pseudo cost function. The expected demand is found via a nearest-neighbor data-mining algorithm using historic data. The optimization algorithm is used in conjunction with long-term simulations assuming different user behavior patterns and optimization strategies.

While there were a number of factors which drove historical increases in distribution costs, management of peak demand growth could help contain or reduce the extent to which consumers, particularly households, experience further increases in distribution costs. The paper demonstrates how different combinations of carbon price and peak demand scenarios could impact future residential and industrial retail electricity prices to 2050 and discusses some behavioural and technological solutions to manage peak demand and potential barriers to their deployment. \u00a9 2015 Elsevier Ltd.", "2015"]

Energy management systems and smart appliances can facilitate this by supporting the user to shift electricity demand of appliances to moments in time when electricity is abundantly available. However, the benefits resulting from domestic demand response depend on household acceptance and behaviour change. This paper explores the real electricity demand shift of households in time and the role of smart appliances to bring about this shift. A longitudinal study was conducted among Dutch households over a period of one year. The households received a dynamic electricity tariff, an energy management system and a smart washing machine. Results show that households shift their usage of the smart washing machine mostly to the day when the sun is shining and electricity is produced by their own solar panels. Households who regularly used automation of the smart washing machine, which implicates that the use of the washing machine is automatically shifted to time periods where electricity supply is abundantly available, were more likely to shift their electricity usage. Furthermore, during the course of one year, the results remained stable, indicating a structural shift in demand. \u00a9 2015 Elsevier Ltd.", "2015"]

Particular attention is paid to new forms of cooperation that are arising between households (horizontal opening-up) and between households and service providers (vertical opening-up). Data are drawn from an online survey and a focus group discussion among householders who have some experience with sustainable energy practices. To guide the analysis we discern three energy management practices that come along with the advent of smart energy systems (energy monitoring, renewable energy production and time-shifting), and three social arrangements entailing different ways of organising these practices (private, horizontal and vertical arrangements). While survey respondents, in general, prove to be supportive of both vertically and horizontally arranged energy management practices, we also find that they run into specific privacy and autonomy problems that shape or even impede their participation. In addition, the focus group shows that shared understandings of conventional energy systems and shared experiences with alternative schemes create strong parallels between anticipated arrangements of new practices. It is concluded that decentralised systems are particularly promising for promoting householder participation, as they enable the bundling of energy management practices and the renegotiation of horizontal-vertical relationships. \u00a9 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, we propose a Cost-for-Deviation (CfD) retail-pricing scheme, which is designed to minimize the demand uncertainty of individual customers or communities. We formulate day-ahead planning and real-time tracking optimization problems for individual buildings. We also formulate CfD pricing scheme for community of two buildings and devise a collaboration scheme by which the two buildings negotiate. Both centralized and distributed negotiation mechanisms are presented, and the significance of adopting a transaction cost for fair-trading is discussed. A series of experiments demonstrate that CfD pricing is able to reduce demand uncertainty in a building or a community. Hence, a community's cost of hedging quantity risk in the real-time market also reduces.

With the advent of high-resolution time-series power demand data through advanced metering, mining this data could be costly from the computational viewpoint. One of the popular techniques is clustering, but depending on the algorithm the resolution of the data can have an important influence on the resulting clusters.

With an increasingly ageing population, the awareness and views of older people on energy use, technology, smart meters, smart grids are becoming progressively more important.

If heat pumps would be installed in large numbers in the future, the question arises whether all building types show equal benefits and thus should be given the same priority for deployment. This paper aims at answering this question by determining the CO2-abatement cost of installing a heat pump instead of a condensing gas boiler for residential space heating and domestic hot-water production. The electricity system, as well as the building types, are based on a possible future Belgian setting in 2030 with high RES penetration at the electricity-generation side. The added value of this work compared to the current scientific literature lies in the integrated approach, taking both the electricity-generation system and a bottom up building stock model into account. Furthermore, this paper analyzes the possible benefits of active demand response in this framework. The results show that the main drivers for determining the CO2-abatement cost are the renovation level of the building and the type of heat pump installed. For thoroughly insulated buildings, an air-coupled heat pump combined with floor heating is the most economic heating system in terms of CO2-abatement cost. Finally, performing active demand response shows clear benefits in reducing costs. Substantial peak shaving can be achieved, making peak capacity at the electricity generation side superfluous, hence lowering the overall CO2-abatement cost. \u00a9 2015 Elsevier Ltd.", "2015"]

We introduce an integrated model for total annual system cost that can be used to determine a cost-minimizing allocation of renewable asset investments. The model includes production, uncertainty, emission, capacity expansion and mothballing costs, as well as wind variability and demand elasticity to determine the hourly cost of electricity delivery. The model is applied to a 2024 planning case for British Columbia, Canada. Results show that cost is minimized at about 30% wind generation.

DR in commercial buildings can play a major role in reducing peak load and mitigate network overloading conditions. Small and medium-sized commercial buildings have not historically played much role as a DR resource both due to lack of hardware and software tools and awareness. This paper presents a peak load reduction computing tool for commercial building DR applications. The proposed tool provides optimal control of building's cooling set points with the aim to reduce building's peak load, while maintaining occupant comfort measured by the Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) index. This is unlike other studies which use global cooling set point adjustment resulting in an uneven distribution of occupant satisfaction across the building. The approach is validated by experimentation conducted on a simulated medium-sized office building, which reflects an existing commercial building in Virginia, USA. Research findings indicate that the proposed methodology can effectively reduce the simulated building's peak load and energy consumption during a DR event, while maintaining occupant comfort requirements.

In particular, this study investigates to what extent residential heat pumps participating in load shifting can contribute to reducing operational costs and CO2 emissions associated with electric power generation and how home owners with heat pump systems can be best motivated to achieve these flexibility benefits. Residential heat pumps, when intelligently orchestrated in their operation, can lower operational costs and CO2 emissions by performing load shifting in order to reduce curtailment of electricity from renewable energy sources and improve the efficiency of dispatchable power plants. In order to study the interaction, both the electricity generation system and residences with heat pumps are modeled. In a first step, an integrated modeling approach is presented which represents the idealized case where the electrical grid operation in terms of unit commitment and dispatch is concurrently optimized with that of a large number of residential heat pumps located in homes designed to low-energy design standards. While this joint optimization approach does not lend itself for real-time implementation, it serves as an upper bound for the achievable operational cost savings. The main focus of this paper is to assess to what extent load shifting incentives are able to achieve the aforementioned savings potential. Two types of incentives are studied: direct load control and dynamic time-of-use pricing. Since both the electricity generation supply system and the residential building stock with heat pumps had been modeled for the joint optimization, the performance of both load shifting incentives can be compared by separately assessing the supply and demand side. Superior performance is noted for the direct-load control scenario, achieving 60-90% of the cost savings attained in the jointly optimized best-case scenario. In dynamic time-of-use pricing, poor performance in terms of reduced cost and emissions is noted when the heat pumps response is not taken into account. When the heat pumps response is taken into account, dynamic time-of-use pricing performs better. However, both dynamic time-of-use pricing schemes show inferior performance at high levels of residential heat pump penetration. \u00a9 2016 Elsevier Ltd.", "2016"]

As the flexible share of the total consumption remains small, the non-smart share represents a financial risk for the consumer. The smart appliances were well received by the users and no response fatigue was observed. However, there was a high variation in the group of pilot participants, both in terms of energy consumption as in terms of flexibility offered. \u00a9 2015 Elsevier Ltd.", "2015"]

Hourly electricity meter data, weather data, and response data from a household survey are merged into a large panel data set, and multiple regression models are applied to isolate the impacts of different heating systems for each hour of the day during the heating period. The results show that compared to direct electric heating, the additional use of air-to-air heat pumps, wood burning stoves, and oil stoves leads to relatively constant reductions in hourly electricity consumption over the course of the day while largest reductions - especially during hours of morning peak consumption - are achieved by using non-electric central heating systems. The presented method can be applied to other energy carriers, metering intervals and consumer groups and - depending on the data available - be used to model individual and aggregate regional energy demand with a high temporal resolution as well as to analyze how area-wide changes in climatic factors and important consumer characteristics will affect consumption of different energy carriers in smart energy systems. \u00a9 2015 Elsevier Ltd.", "2015"]

Therefore, time-critical, variable charges are likely to be introduced. Whereas large consumers of electricity already have to pay attention to this issue - the peak demand is measured and cost effective for customers with a consumption higher than 100,000 kW h or connection power more than 50 kW [1] - the topic will become relevant for other customers in the future. Due to the roll-out of smart metres, it is very likely that time-relevant tariffs will become standard for all kinds of users, which means that the moment of electricity consumption will be cost-relevant. This paper deals with the electric load behaviour of office buildings and their potential to use demand side management (DSM) to optimise load behaviour. Because of use during the day, when prices are usually higher than during the night, office buildings mainly demand electrical energy during periods of high prices. By identification and utilisation of DSM potential, considerable sections of the demand can be shifted to hours with lower prices. Concerning integration of photovoltaic systems, two aspects has to be taken into account. When PV is an additional option to reduce electrical energy demand during high prices, on-site produced electricity should be also used on-site and therefore it has to be assured, that demand does not fall below PV-production. Another possibility to shift loads is to use thermal or electrochemical storage systems. \u00a9 2014 Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart New York.", "2015"]

The system consists of the PV modules, grid, battery, HPWH, diesel generator (DG) and other domestic appliances. The PV can simultaneously feed in the excess power to the grid and supply the loads. The battery is used as storage of cheaper-to-buy off-peak grid energy, dependent on the time-of-use (TOU) electricity tariff, while the DG is a backup power source to the HPWH. The objective function of the model is to minimize energy and fuel cost while maximizing PV energy trade-off for incentives. The TOU is an important control parameter in this model. The power flows from each power source are the control variables. The optimal control shows a great potential to realize a practical net zero-energy building and demand side management.

In the Emirate of Abu Dhabi, one of the seven Emirates of the United Arab Emirates (UAE), about 84% of 2012 electricity use can be traced back to buildings - of which close to 60% is devoted to indoor air-conditioning. Almost untapped, energy efficiency in the existing buildings sector has a huge potential for development. Under the current political/economic scenario, heavy subsidies on retail electricity and water prices are in place, amounting to $4.8 billion in 2014, although a slight reduction is expected in 2015. Subsidized electricity is probably the most important barrier to energy efficiency. It is also often one of the most difficult to alleviate in developing countries because of undesirable societal and political repercussions. In this study, a series of building retrofits were tested on a model of a typical building in the Emirate. A retrofit consisting in the replacement of the existing chiller by one operating at 25% higher efficiency is selected in order to assess a proposed tradable energy efficiency certificates scheme. The selected retrofit, despite its high initial cost, is shown to have a significant impact on energy consumption and, if implemented on all candidate sites according to its full technical potential, produces Emirate-wide annual electricity savings of around 8% and peak demand reduction of around 13.5%. Under the current subsidized electricity price scheme, investments in energy efficiency of existing buildings are not attractive for the typical ESCO, as over the lifecycle of the measure, the return on investment is low or negative. This paper studies the feasibility of energy savings obligations and tradable white certificates as a mechanism to enable private sector involvement in demand-side energy efficiency by guaranteeing an attracive internal rate of return. Based on the outcome of this analysis, we believe that a white certificates market would be an effective tool to jump-start buildings energy efficiency in the Emirate. \u00a9 2015 Elsevier Ltd.", "2016"]

Demand side management (DSM) with its ability to allow customers to adjust electricity consumption in response to market signals has often been recognized as an efficient way to mitigate the variable effects of renewable energy as well as to increase system efficiency and reduce system costs. However, the academic & industrial literature have taken divergent approaches to DSM implementation. While the popular approach among academia adopts a social welfare maximization formulation, the industrial practice compensates customers according to their load reduction from a predefined electricity consumption baseline that would have occurred without DSM. This paper rigorously compares these two different approaches in a day-ahead wholesale market context analytically and in a test case using the same system configuration and mathematical formalism. The comparison of the two models showed that a proper reconciliation of the two models might make them mitigate the stochastic netload in fundamentally the same way, but only under very specific conditions which are rarely met in practice. While the social welfare model uses a stochastic net load composed of two terms, the industrial DSM model uses a stochastic net load composed of three terms including the additional baseline term. DSM participants are likely to manipulate the baseline in order to receive greater financial compensation. An artificially inflated baseline is shown to result in a different resources dispatch, high system costs, and unachievable social welfare, and likely requires more control activity in subsequent layers of enterprise control. \u00a9 2015.", "2015"]

In this study heat demand profiles and annual electricity-to-heat factors of ECMs in buildings are computed and their impact on system efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions of a Swedish biomass fuelled and combined heat and power utilising DHS are assessed. A weather normalising method for the DHS heat load is developed, combining segmented multivariable linear regressions with typical meteorological year weather data to enable the DHS model and the buildings model to work under the same weather conditions. Improving the buildings' envelope insulation level and thereby levelling out the DHS heat load curve reduces greenhouse gas emissions and improves primary energy efficiency. Reducing household electricity use proves to be highly beneficial, partly because it increases heat demand, allowing for more cogeneration of electricity. However the other ECMs considered may cause increased greenhouse gas emissions, mainly because of their adverse impact on the cogeneration of electricity.

When conventional thermostats are retrofitted for real-time price DR control, significant control errors can arise, particularly in the form of dispatch control drift.

Compared to the current value, the annual renovation rate per province would need to be at least doubled in order to reach the 2030 target independent of reasonable climatic and population changes in the future. Our findings also underline the importance of policy measures as the annual renovation rate is a key influencing factor regarding the reduction of the heating energy demand in dwellings. \u00a9 2015 Elsevier Ltd.", "2015"]

The objective of this paper is to define consumer showering patterns, and analyze the influence of the power demand measurement time resolution on the potential of peak time power demand reduction provided by Domestic Solar Hot Water (DSHW) systems. Results show that the measurement of electrical power demand in a 15-min interval is not adequate to evaluate and verify the benefits provided by the use of DSHW systems, because it heavily underestimates the active power demand reduction at peak hours.

This paper studies cost-optimal and rule-based control for buildings with PV, employing a heat pump, thermal and electrical storage and shiftable loads as flexibility sources to increase the value of PV for the prosumer. The cost-optimal control minimizes variable electricity cost employing market data on electricity price and optionally constrains grid feed-in to zero; the rule-based control aims at maximizing PV self-consumption. The flexibility strategies are combined into a simulation model to analyze different system configurations over a full year.The applicability of the new model is demonstrated with a case study with empirical data from a real low-energy house in Southern Finland. Compared to inflexible reference control with a constant price for bought electricity, cost-optimal control employing hourly market price of electricity achieved 13-25% savings in the yearly electricity bill. Moreover, 8-88% decrease in electricity fed into the grid was obtained. The exact values depend on PV capacity and the flexibility options chosen.

DSM can include measures such as energy-efficient system design, automated control and energy management systems, or policies and monitoring systems intended to alter user behavior. For an energy-efficient modern residence designed within a tropical context, several DSM strategies are considered for reductions in operational-phase energy consumption: a lightweight, thermally high-performing building envelope, installation of light dimmers to enhance user control of lighting, and comparison of a solar hot water system versus a point-of-use electric water heater to produce hot water for bathing demands. The energy-consumption savings associated with the three DSM strategies are simulated and normalized to an energy savings per cost of implementation basis in kWh per 1000 Thai Baht (THB) for comparison. The results show that financial investments in low-energy hot water heaters (i.e., solar water heating systems) result in relatively higher energy savings per unit financial investment than the other two strategies. Conversely, the installation of a lightweight, well-insulated envelope is highly expensive relative to its associated energy savings over a 25-year time frame.

A Monte Carlo approach; Abstract: Wind and solar energy are expected to play a major role in the current decade to help Europe reaching the renewable energy penetration targets fixed by Directive 2009/28/EC. However, it is difficult to predict the actual production profiles of wind and solar energy as they depend heavily on variable meteorological features of solar radiation and wind speed. In an ideal system, wind and solar electricity are both injected in a fast reacting grid instantaneously matching supply and demand. In such a system wind and solar electricity production profiles should complement each other as much as possible in order to minimise the need of storage and additional capacity. In the present paper the complementarity of wind and solar resources is assessed for a test year in Italy.To achieve this goal we employ data at high spatial and temporal resolution data for both solar radiation and wind speed in Italy obtained from running two state of the art models (PVGIS and MINNI). Hourly profiles for solar and wind energy produced are compared in each 4\u00d74km2 grid cell in Italy for 2005, and hourly, daily and monthly correlation coefficients are computed in order to assess the local complementarity of the two resources. A Monte Carlo approach is also developed to estimate how large-scale wind and solar energy productions could be potentially involved to complement each other in a scenario with up to 100 production sites across Italy. The results show how local complementarity can be very interesting with monthly correlation coefficients reaching values lower than-0.8 in several areas. Large-scale complementarity is also relevant with nation-wide monthly correlation coefficients showing values between-0.65 and-0.6.

While most of these programs are deemed to be cost effective, and therefore in the public interest, opportunities exist to improve cost effectiveness by targeting programs to those customers with the greatest potential for energy savings. This article details an analysis of three DSM programs offered by three Florida municipal electric utilities to explore such opportunities. First, we estimate programs' energy savings impacts; second, we measure and compare energy savings across subgroups of program participants as determined by their pre-intervention energy performance, and third, we explore potential changes in program impacts that might be realized by targeting specific customers for participation in the DSM programs. All three programs resulted in statistically significant average (per-participant) energy savings, yet average savings varied widely, with the customers who performed best (i.e., most efficient) before the intervention saving the least energy and those who performed worst (i.e., least efficient) before the intervention saving the most. Assessment of alternative program participation scenarios with varying levels of customer targeting suggests that program impacts could be increased by as much as 80% for a professional energy audit program, just over 100% for a high-efficiency heat pump upgrade program, and nearly 250% for an attic insulation upgrade program.

Using this otherwise discarded energy by strategically increasing demand at times that would otherwise require curtailment has the potential to reduce the installed capacity of wind required to meet the national 2020 target.Considering two industrial electricity consumers, this study analyses the potential for the implementation of price based demand response by an industrial consumer to increase their proportional use of wind generated electricity by shifting their demand towards times of low prices. Results indicate that while curtailing during peak price times has little or no benefit in terms of wind energy consumption, demand shifting towards low price times is likely to increase a consumer's consumption of wind generation by approximately 5.8% for every 10% saved on the consumer's average unit price of electricity. \u00a9 2013 Elsevier Ltd.", "2014"]

The development of energy demand is a key driver of the future energy system.

Long-term energy demand projections are uncertain and the purpose of this paper is to illustrate the impact of different projections on the energy system. The results of the analyses show that decreased energy demand results in a higher renewable fraction compared to an increased demand, and the renewable energy production increases with increased energy demand. The most profitable solution to cover increased demand is to increase the use of bio energy and to implement energy efficiency measures.

Most often, energy demand is mathematically formulated by socio-economic indicators. The challenging problem is to determine the optimal or near optimal weighting factors. Inspired by social behavior of bird flocking or fish schooling, PSO (particle swarm optimization) is a population-based search technique which has attracted significant attention to tackle the complexity of difficult optimization problems. This paper studies the performance of different PSO variants for estimating Iran's electricity demand. Seven PSO variants namely, original PSO, PSO-w (PSO with weighting factor), PSO-cf (PSO with constriction factor), PSO-rf (PSO with repulsion factor), PSO-vc (PSO with velocity control), CLPSO (comprehensive learning PSO) and a MPSO (modified PSO), are used to find the unknown weighting factors based on the data from 1982 to 2003. The validation process is then conducted by testing the optimized models by using the data from 2004 to 2009. It is seen that PSO-vc produces more promising results than the other variants, HS (harmony search) and ABSO (artificial bee swarm optimization) algorithms in terms of MAPE (mean absolute percentage error).

According to Pike Research (Jerram and Gartner, 2012), it is anticipated that by 2020 there will be approximately 460,000 of them installed worldwide. A typical public DC fast charger delivers a maximum power output of 50kW which allows a typical passenger vehicle to be 80% charged in 10-15min, compared with 6-8h for a 6.6kW AC level 2 charging unit. While DC fast chargers offer users the convenience of being able to rapidly charge their vehicle, the unit's high power demand has the potential to put sudden strain on the electricity network, and incur significant demand charges.Depending on the utility rate structure, a DC fast charger can experience annual demand charges of several thousand dollars. Therefore in these cases there is an opportunity to mitigate or even avoid the demand charges incurred by coupling the unit with an appropriately sized energy storage system and coordinating the way in which it integrates. This paper explores the technical and economical suitability of coupling a ground energy storage system with a DC fast charge unit for mitigation or avoidance of demand charges and lessening the impact on the local electricity network.

In cases of mismatch between power supply and demand, FR resources either on the generation or the demand side, responding rapidly to restore system frequency to its nominal value. Due to the limited responsiveness of generators, fast and accurate demand side resources (DSR) have recently been encouraged to participate in FR. However, the tested DSRs typically require high initial equipment investment (e.g., flywheels and batteries). Large commercial buildings can provide effective load shaping with little impact to occupants' comfort and have significant amount of available capacity for FR participation. In addition, commercial buildings are characterized by numerous interdependent HVAC subsystems and control systems. Therefore, a high-level supervisory control strategy is needed that directs the interdependent HVAC systems for FR with strengthened interactions and depressed counteractions. Simulation results suggest that large commercial buildings can provide significant FR capacity and high performance scores.

The study is based on driving patterns collected from conventional fuel vehicles in the Italian provinces of Modena and Firenze by means of on-board GPS systems. The analysis is carried out over one month, considering approximately 28,000 vehicles and 36. million kilometres. Two types of battery electric vehicles and five recharging behavioural models are considered, to evaluate the trips and the fleet share suitable to be served by EVs, by following all the trips and parking sequences in the databases. This allows deriving the impact on the electricity grid of the electrification of urban vehicles in terms of additional electric energy demand and its geographical distribution. The results show that more than 80% of the urban trips can be covered by electric vehicles and that an urban fleet share between 8% and 28% could be replaced by the current generation of electric vehicles without any change in their driving patterns. The derived electric energy demand increase remains below 5% of the total electric energy demand, and below 20% of the domestic electric energy demand in the analysed areas. The geographical analysis shows in detail how this additional demand is distributed over the areas analysed, and how it compares with the already available recharging infrastructures in the two provinces.

The imprudent use of antibiotics is threatening the capacity of the healthcare system internationally. Similarly, in Australia the increasing reliance on air-conditioning to maintain thermal comfort is contributing to rising peak demand and electricity prices, and is placing an inequitable health and financial burden on vulnerable heat-stressed households. This paper analyses policy responses to these problems through the lens of social practice theory. In the health sector, campaigns are attempting to emphasise the social health implications of antibiotic use. In considering this approach in relation to the problem of air-conditioned cooling and how to change the ways in which people keep cool during peak times, our analysis draws on interviews with 80 Australian households. We find that the problem of peak electricity demand may be reduced through attention to the social health implications of air-conditioned cooling on very hot days.

Locally installed microgrids along with consumer demand response can be suitable decentralized options to augment the centralized grid based systems and plug the demand-supply gap.

In this paper, we propose a distributed framework for the demand response based on cost minimization. Each user in the system will find an optimal start time and operating mode for the appliances in response to the varying electricity prices. We model the cost function for each user and the constraints for the appliances. We then propose an approximate greedy iterative algorithm that can be employed by each user to schedule appliances. In the proposed algorithm, each user requires only the knowledge of the price of the electricity, which depends on the aggregated load of other users, instead of the load profiles of individual users. In order for the users to coordinate with each other, we introduce a penalty term in the cost function, which penalizes large changes in the scheduling between successive iterations. Numerical simulations show that our optimization method will result in lower cost for the consumers, lower generation costs for the utility companies, lower peak load, and lower load fluctuations. \u00a9 2010-2012 IEEE.", "2014"]

These programs are tailored to offer monetary incentives to electricity customers so that they voluntarily consume electricity in an efficient way. Thus, DSM presents households with numerous opportunities to lower their electricity bills. However, systems that combine the various DSM strategies with a view to maximizing energy management benefits have not received sufficient attention. This study therefore proposes an intelligent energy management framework that can be used to implement both energy storage and appliance scheduling schemes. By adopting appliance scheduling, customers can realize cost savings by appropriately scheduling their power consumption during the low peak hours. More savings could further be achieved through smart electricity storage. Power storage allows electricity consumers to purchase power during off-peak hours when electricity prices are low and satisfy their demands when prices are high by discharging the batteries. For optimal cost savings, the customers must constantly monitor the price fluctuations in order to determine when to switch between the utility grid and the electricity storage devices. However, with a high penetration of consumer owned storage devices, the charging of the batteries must be properly coordinated and appropriately scheduled to avoid creating new peaks.

Previous research in ANM was focused on distribution areas with significant renewable penetration, where ANM reduced network pressure through significantly enhanced generation curtailment strategies rather than adopting traditional asset investment. This paper proposes the use of electric vehicles (EVs) as responsive demand to complement network stress relief that was purely based on generation curtailment. It is achieved by allowing EVs to absorb excessive renewable generation when they cause network pressure, and it thus can provide additional measures to generation curtailment strategies. The approach is illustrated on a practical extra-high voltage distribution system. The analyses clearly demonstrate the combined management of demand and generation is superior to previous sole generation management. The combined management strategy can achieve 7.9% improvement in utilization of renewable energy, and subsequently increase the net investment profit by \u00a3566 k. \u00a9 2013 IEEE.", "2014"]

Cooling systems consume up to 25% of the total electricity used on deep mines. These systems are integrated with the water reticulation system to provide chilled service water to the mine and provide cool ventilation air. A new energy efficiency strategy, based on variable water flow, was developed for the unique demands of an integrated mine cooling system. The strategy is based on procedures such as matching the evaporator thermal requirements to the demand for chilled water, adapting the condensers to the heat load, and matching the bulk air cooler with the demand of ventilation air requirements. A suitable simulation model of integrated mine cooling systems was developed, verified and used to predict the potential results of implementing the new strategy on actual mine systems. In this paper, an overview of the developed strategy and simulation model is presented. The verified simulations show that a decrease of 33% in overall electrical energy consumption is possible by implementing the proposed energy saving intervention. The potential is also shown for application and expansion to large systems outside the mining industry. \u00a9 2015 Elsevier Ltd.", "2015"]

This demand becomes flexible if investing in complementing heat storage capabilities. In this study, we analyse how the heat pumps can influence the integration of wind power by applying an energy system model that optimises both investments and operation, and covers various heat storage options. The Danish energy system by 2030 with around 50-60% wind power is used as a case study. Results show that the heat pumps, even without flexible operation, can contribute significantly to facilitating larger wind power investments and reducing system costs, fuel consumption, and CO2 emissions. Investments in heat storages can provide only moderate system benefits in these respects. The main benefit of the flexible heat pump operation is a reduced need for peak/reserve capacity, which is also crucial for the feasibility of the heat storages.

Energy intensity, defined herewith, as the ratio of the total primary energy consumption (TPE) to the GDP, is a useful concept for Understanding the relation between energy demand and economic development. The scope of this article is to assess the future primary energy consumption of Nepal, and the projection is carried out along with the formulation of simple linear logarithmic energy consumption models. This initiates with a hypothesis that energy consumption is dependent with the national macro-economic parameters. To test the hypothesis, nexus between energy consumption and possible determinant variables are examined. Status of energy consumption between the period of 1996 and 2009, and for the same period, growth of economic parameters are assessed. Three scenarios are developed differing from each other on the basis of growth rates of economic indicators: total GDP, GDP-agriculture, GDP-trade, GDP-industry, and other variables including growth in private consumptions, population, transport vehicles numbers, prices of fossil fuels etc. Scenarios are: Business as Usual (BAU), Medium Growth Scenario (MGS) and High Growth Scenario (HGS). Energy consumption in all the sectors and for all fuel types are not statistically correlated with every economic parameters tested in the assessment. Hence, the statistically correlated models are included in the prognosis of energy consumption. For example, the TPE consumption and electricity consumption, both are significantly dependent with the total GDP and population growth. Likewise, fuel wood consumption is significantly dependent with the growth in rural population and private consumptions. In BAU the estimated electricity consumption in 2030 would be 7.97TWh, which is 3.47 times higher than that of 2009. In MGS, the total electricity consumption in 2030 is estimated to increase by a factor of 5.71 compared to 2009.

However, the integration of RES in the electricity grid increases the complexity of the grid management due to the variability and the intermittent nature of these energy sources. Energy storage solutions such as batteries offer either short-term storage that is not sufficient or longer period storage that is significantly expensive. This paper introduces an energy management approach which can be applied in the case of power and desalinated water generation. The approach is based on mathematical optimization model which accounts for random variations in demands and energy supply. The approach allows using desalination plants as a deferrable load to mitigate for the variability of the renewable energy supply and water and/or electricity demands. A mathematical linear programming model is developed to show the applicability of this idea and its effectiveness in reducing the impact of the uncertainty in the environment. The model is solved for the real world case of Saudi Arabia.

This paper addresses interactions between energy supply- and demand-side policies, by estimating the impact of measures addressing end-use energy efficiency and small-scale renewables uses in terms of (1) avoided large-scale electricity generation capacity, (2) final energy consumption, (3) share of renewables in final energy and (4) reduction of GHG emissions. The Portuguese energy system is used as a case study. The TIMES_PT bottom-up model was used to generate four scenarios covering the period up to 2020, corresponding to different levels of efficiency of equipment in buildings, transport and industry. In the current policy scenario, the deployment of end-use equipment follows the 2000-2005 trends and the National Energy Efficiency Action Plan targets. In the efficient scenarios, all types of equipment can be replaced by more efficient ones. Results show that aggressive demand-side options for the industry and buildings sector and the small-scale use of renewables can remove the need for the increase in large-scale renewable electricity capacity by 4.7 GW currently discussed by policy makers. Although these measures reduce total final energy by only 0-2 %, this represents reductions of 11-14 % in the commercial sector, with savings in total energy system costs of approximately 3,000 million euros2000-roughly equivalent to 2 % of the 2010 Portuguese GDP.

Two basic load-following methods following the thermal load (FTL) and following the electric load (FEL), are compared with a hybrid method which either follows the thermal or the electric demand in a given time period, within a specified operating range, in order to minimize the amount of excess electrical or thermal energy produced by the CHP system. These methods are implemented on an hour by hour basis for a large hotel benchmark building which is modeled in 16 cities located in different climate zones using EnergyPlus building simulation software. The hybrid method results in a higher total CHP system efficiency than either the FTL or FEL methods, with CHP system efficiency values from 71% to 87%. The power-to-heat ratio of the building (PHRb), which describes the relationship between electrical and thermal demand for the given facility, is found to predict the maximum possible CHP system efficiency using the hybrid method on an hourly basis. Buildings with lower PHRb values, corresponding to higher relative thermal demands, have the highest possible CHP system efficiency values. The hybrid operational method is also implemented on a monthly basis, where the building's average monthly demands are used to set the operating condition of the prime mover for the entire month. The building is then simulated on an hour by hour basis to determine the system's performance with only monthly changes in the loading conditions. This monthly method produces similar results to the hybrid method when it is implemented on an hourly basis, with CHP system efficiency values from 74% to 86%. \u00a9 2013 Elsevier Ltd.", "2014"]

However, the uncertainty associated with such demand responses, modelled through the use of price elasticities, has often been ignored. This is problematic for two key reasons - elasticity factors used in models are highly uncertain due to the limited evidence base, while at the same time, demand response has been observed as a critical mechanism for meeting long term climate mitigation targets. This paper makes two important contributions for improving the understanding of the role of price-induced demand response. Firstly, it attempts to address the problem of unsatisfactory elasticity input assumptions by undertaking an up-to-date review of the literature. Secondly, the role of demand response under uncertainty is assessed using a probabilistic approach, focusing on its contribution to mitigation. The paper highlights that demand response does play a critical role in mitigation, ensuring a more cost-effective transition to a low carbon energy system. Crucially, the uncertainties associated with price elasticities do not weaken this finding. The transport sector is the driver of this demand response leading to important implications for policy and the focus of demand side interventions. \u00a9 2014 Elsevier Ltd.", "2014"]

Close similarity between the simulation and experimental results gave us the confidence to use this electric spring model for investigating the effectiveness of their collective operation when distributed in large number across a power system.

Controllers simultaneously optimize two possibly conflicting objectives: minimization of energy costs for the end user (considering a known, time-dependent tariff) and stabilization of the aggregate load profile (load flattening). The former objective can be optimized independently by each controller. On the other hand, the latter could benefit from a communication infrastructure that allows the controllers to explicitly exchange information and coordinate. To study how different levels of communication pervasiveness affect system performance, we developed a realistic micro-simulation environment accounting for the behavior of residents, dispatchable and non-dispatchable household loads, and the effects on the distribution network. We considered a generic model of communication among household controllers, not tied to any specific technology, and based on the partitioning of the households in a number of groups (neighborhoods). Controllers within the same neighborhood enjoy full connectivity, but cannot interact with controllers outside of their neighborhood. Through extensive simulation experiments, we observed that even communication neighborhoods constituted by as few as 3-4 households are sufficient to effectively stabilize the aggregate network load profile, with minimal bandwidth consumption. Increasing the neighborhood size leads to comparatively negligible performance improvements. We conclude that effective load flattening can be achieved with minimal requirements of communication infrastructure and transmitted information. \u00a9 2010-2012 IEEE.", "2014"]

However, the temporal granularity and operational detail these models consider is commonly omitted in the broader family of long-term energy system models.

That case study examined the effects of linking a long-term energy system model (TIMES) with a unit commitment and dispatch model (PLEXOS). It analysed the year 2020 in detail, applying a yearly temporal resolution that is over 700 times higher than in OSeMOSYS. Without increasing temporal resolution (and computational burden) we show that results of the enhanced OSeMOSYS model converge to results of TIMES and PLEXOS: Investment mismatches decrease from 21.4% to 5.0%.

When variability was ignored, power system investments in 2050 were found to be 14.3% lower. This might imply that energy policies derived from such long-term models - of which there are many - may underestimate the costs of introducing variable renewables and thus meeting climate change or energy security targets. \u00a9 2014 Elsevier Ltd.", "2014"]

The end-users at power demand side can actually make use of their demand reduction potentials to contribute to the grid power balance. Conventional demand responses of end-users can provide considerable power demand reductions, but the demand responses are usually subject to significant delay and cannot fulfill the needs of grid real time operation. In this paper, a fast chiller power demand response control strategy for commercial buildings is therefore proposed which facilitates buildings to act as grid \"operating reserves\" by providing rapid demand responses to grid request within minutes. However, simply shutting down some essential operating chillers would result in disordered chilled water flow distribution and uneven indoor thermal comfort degradation. This strategy has therefore taken essential measures to solve such problems effectively. Simulation case studies are conducted to investigate the operation dynamics and energy performance of HVAC systems in the demand response events controlled by the strategy. Results show that fast and significant power demand reductions can be achieved without sacrificing the thermal comfort too much. \u00a9 2014 Elsevier Ltd.", "2015"]

Therefore, the objective of improving the conventional power systems with the capabilities of decentralized generation and advanced control has conflicted with the present power system infrastructure and thus a profound change has necessitated in the current power grids. To that end, the concept of smart grid has been introduced at the last decades in order to accomplish the modernization of the power grid while incorporating various capabilities such as advanced metering, monitoring and self-healing to the systems. Among the various advanced components in smart grid structure, \"smart home\" is of vital importance due to its handling difficulties caused by the stochastic behaviors of inhabitants. However, limited studies concerning the implementation of smart homes have so far been reported in the literature. Motivated by this need, this paper investigates an experimental smart home with various renewable energy sources and storage systems in terms of several aspects such as in-home energy management, appliances control and power flow.

The emergence of smart grid technologies in recent years has seen a paradigm shift in redefining the electrical system of the future, in which controlled response of the demand side is used to balance fluctuations and intermittencies from the generation side. This paper presents a modeling framework for an integrated electricity system where loads become an additional resource. Agent-based modeling is used to represent a smart grid power system integrating generators, transmission, distribution, loads and market. The model incorporates generator and load controllers, allowing suppliers and demanders to bid into a Real-Time Pricing (RTP) electricity market. The modeling framework is applied to represent a physical demonstration project conducted on the Olympic Peninsula, Washington, USA, and validation simulations are performed using actual dynamic data. Wind power is then introduced into the power generation mix illustrating the potential of demand response to mitigate the impact of wind power variability, primarily through thermostatically controlled loads.

Here, three DSM scenarios that vary in capital investment costs of technology retrofits were tested for the contemporary Northeastern US. These resulted in an 8.3-16.5% decrease in summertime regional electricity consumption. The lower power consumption achieved through DSM was analyzed under an additional five SPR (strategic power reduction) scenarios to explore how the reduced electricity demand could be optimized through different modalities of thermoelectric power production that lower human health risks, thermal water pollution, carbon emissions or system costs (operation and maintenance) of power plants. SPR scenarios show potential to lower health risks to nearly two million people with corresponding avoided external costs of $11 billion per year, lower carbon emissions (31%, maximum) and thermal water pollution (37%, maximum). By internalizing external costs, some unfavorable investments (NPV (net present value)<0) turned into favorable ones (NPV>0).

The problem is formulated as a linear programming (LP; or linear optimization) routine and daily minimization of peak non-coincident demand is sought to evaluate the robustness, reliability, and consistency of the battery dispatch algorithm. The LP routine leverages solar power and load forecasts to establish a load demand target (i.e., a minimum threshold to which demand can be reduced using a photovoltaic (PV) array and battery array) that is adjusted throughout the day in response to forecast error. The LP routine perfectly minimizes demand charge but forecasts errors necessitate adjustments to the perfect dispatch schedule. The PV+. system consistently reduced non-coincident demand on a metered load that has an elevated diurnal (i.e., daytime) peak. The average reduction in peak demand on weekdays (days that contain the elevated load peak) was 25.6% in July and 20.5% in November. By itself, the PV array (excluding the battery array) reduced the peak demand on average 19.6% in July and 11.4% in November. PV alone cannot perfectly mitigate load spikes due to inherent variability; the inclusion of a storage device reduced the peak demand a further 6.0% in July and 9.3% in November.

Methods: In this study, we present a detailed buildings energy model with U.S. state-level representation, nested in an integrated assessment framework of the Global Change Assessment Model (GCAM). We project state-level buildings energy demand and its spatial pattern through the end of the century, considering the impact of climate change based on the estimates of heating and cooling degree days derived from downscaled USGS CASCaDE temperature data.

However, when asked to report their energy demand, users may have an incentive to cheat in order to consume more while paying less, causing extra costs for grid operation. So it is important to ensure truthfulness among users for demand side management. In this paper, we propose an efficient pricing method that can prevent users' cheating.

Electrical power storage provides a viable solution to managing power supply and electrical loads as well as unexpected imbalances. Electricity suppliers could deploy electricity storage facilities at various levels of the smart grid system: generation, transmission, substations and residential level. Storage would significantly address the power quality and reliability problems through peak shaving and frequency control. It also reduces the need for huge infrastructural expenditures by making them more efficient. At the residential level, smart storage together with dynamic pricing in the deregulated electricity markets presents the electricity suppliers with a strategy to achieve grid stability. In this paper, we consider a smart grid environment with a high penetration of households' storage batteries. By using an appropriate electricity price structure, the electricity supplier influences households' electricity consumption. On the other hand, the households aim to minimize their electricity bills by capitalizing on price fluctuation to schedule their electrical appliances and coordinate the charging and discharging of their batteries. The electricity supplier has a dynamic power limit for each hour that must not be exceeded by the hourly aggregate load of the households. Further, we assume that in supplying electrical power, the households' electrical devices are given priority over their storage devices. The policy is such that batteries will be charged by the residual power after the appliances loads have been satisfied. The households have to compete for the residual electricity so as to maximize the state of charge of their batteries. We have therefore modeled this system as a non-cooperative Nash equilibrium game where the households are considered as selfish but rational players whose objectives are to optimize their individual utilities. \u00a9 2014 IEEE.", "2014"]

This calls for Demand Side Management solutions propelling change in behaviors of end consumers, with the aim to reduce overall consumption as well as shift it to periods in which demand is lower and where the cost of generating energy is lower. Demand Side Management solutions require detailed knowledge about the patterns of energy consumption. The profile of electricity demand in the residential sector is highly correlated with the time of active occupancy of the dwellings; therefore in this study the occupancy patterns in Spanish properties was determined using the 2009-2010 Time Use Survey (TUS), conducted by the National Statistical Institute of Spain. The survey identifies three peaks in active occupancy, which coincide with morning, noon and evening. This information has been used to input into a stochastic model which generates active occupancy profiles of dwellings, with the aim to simulate domestic electricity consumption. TUS data were also used to identify which appliance-related activities could be considered for Demand Side Management solutions during the three peaks of occupancy. \u00a9 2013 Elsevier Ltd.", "2013"]

Such pulses can alleviate power fluctuations by intermittent resources and maintain balance between generation and demand. Building on a prior work [1], we introduce timers to endpoint TCL control enabling better shaping of power pulses. We demonstrate that such an upgrade can be used to create new safe protocols and enable load following applications with response at minute time scales. The advantage of this strategy is the use of only minimal aggregate information about a TCL ensemble and no need for additional control of TCLs to alleviate unwanted power oscillations. \u00a9 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Autonomous DSM programs have recently been proposed to achieve this goal by coordinating the users' energy consumption, using smart meters. On the other hand, this objective can be achieved only when the users actively contribute in DSM programs. Devising a fair billing mechanism is important to encourage the users to keep their contribution in the programs to achieve system optimality in the sense of minimum cost of the system. Another important issue in implementing DSM programs is protecting the users' privacy which is short addressed in DSM literature. In this paper, we introduce the concept of fairness, optimality and privacy in DSM systems. Next, we introduce a class of optimal billing mechanisms. We propose a subclass of optimal billing mechanisms which is fair in terms of distributing the energy cost across the users based on their contribution in minimizing the total cost of system. We show that fairness axioms which have been previously introduced in resource allocation algorithms are achievable in the proposed billing subclass.

The basic frame work of a smart grid is made to ease the complexity of integration of Distributed Renewable Energy Sources (DRES) with greater grid penetration, reduction of transmission losses, optimized energy capacity expansion with better demand side management and hierarchical control for grid security. Smart grids consists of four unique features which can be given as Integration, Control, Communication and Metering (ICCM). Integration refers to connection of heterogeneous type of energy sources with AC or DC grid using appropriate converters. Power output of the DRES is dependent on climatic conditions like wind speed and solar irradiance. Controls in smart grids are made intelligent to extract the maximum power from the sources, operational scheduling of energy sources and overloads, control of transients, real and reactive power. For effective operation of the diverse smart grid, communication between various control nodes is necessary. Communication standards for smart grids usually are set by protocols, and most of them involve the interconnection of Secure Communication Line (SCL) to the main control unit by LAN (Local Area Network), HAN (Home Area Network), and WAN (Wide Area Network). The interconnection should be accompanied with a firewall at various levels for the cyber security of the smart grid. Smart metering employed in smart grids provides additional information of the electrical energy consumed compared to conventional energy meters. Smart metering can measure the energy parameters of the load remotely and transfer the data through the communication network.

Modeling offshore discoveries and import uncertainty of natural gas in Israel; Abstract: Israel depends on natural gas imports from Egypt for about 40% of its domestic needs, with the remaining met from domestic production. Gas supplies from Egypt have been erratic since their initiation: disruptions have increased after the 2011 revolution in Egypt and have been further ignited by public discontent. Despite these developments, Israeli policy makers have viewed the Egyptian gas deal as a positive factor in preserving peace with Egypt and have had no better alternatives than relying upon it. This has changed, however, after recent discoveries of three major offshore fields that are expected to satisfy domestic demand for an indefinite period and to provide gas for exports. We use an extended global CGE modeling framework that incorporates multiple households and factor ownership to investigate the effects of reduced gas imports from Egypt and the evolvement of domestic gas production as an alternative. In case of reduced gas imports from Egypt, the Israeli economy would slightly retract mainly due to lower production in energy intensive sectors. Poor households would be the most negatively affected, due to the strongest relative decline in income and the strongest increase of their consumer price index. In the case of increasing domestic gas production, Israeli GDP and domestic absorption would rise by about 0.2% and 0.4%, respectively. Poor households would be more positively affected than rich ones due to their composition of factor income and their higher expenditure shares for energy intensive commodities. \u00a9 2014 Elsevier Ltd.", "2014"]

By \"smart-scheduling\" the electricity and domestic hot water demand of the dishwasher, clothes washer, dryer, sinks and showers solely to off-peak periods, the peak demand is reduced by 18%, the part-peak demand by 32% and the off-peak demand increased by 12%.

But, under current rates smart-scheduling is found to be worthwhile only during the months from May through October, when 96% of the credits are accumulated. If the rate schedule is altered to include peak-periods during the winter months, the credit savings will double again in value.

While demand response resources are technically capable of providing these services, current experience across the U.S. illustrates they are relatively minor players in most regions. Accessing demand response resources for ancillary services may require a number of changes to policies and common practices at multiple levels. Regional reliability councils must first define ancillary services such that demand response resources may provide them. Once the opportunity exists, balancing authorities define and promulgate rules that set the infrastructure investments and performance attributes of a resource wishing to provide such services. These rules also dictate expected revenue streams which reveal the cost effectiveness of these resources. The regulatory compact between utility and state regulators, along with other statutes and decisions by state policymakers, may impact the interest of demand response program providers to pursue these resources as ancillary service providers.

Subsequently, for the scenario where there is a central unit calculating and sending the real-time aggregated load to all consumers, we develop a one timescale distributed iterative proximal-point algorithm with provable convergence to achieve the NE of the formulated game. Finally, considering the alternative situation where the central unit does not exist, but the consumers are connected and they would like to share their estimated information with others, we present a distributed synchronous agreement-based algorithm and a distributed asynchronous gossip-based algorithm, by which the consumers can achieve the NE of the formulated game through exchanging information with their immediate neighbors. \u00a9 2014 IEEE.", "2014"]

The conventional adequacy and reliability analysis methods related to bulk generation systems cannot be applied directly for the evaluation of adequacy criteria such as 'energy supply' and 'continuity of service' for distribution networks embedded with renewable DG. In this paper, new indices highlighting 'available supply capacity' and 'continuity of service' are proposed for 'energy supply' and 'continuation of service' evaluation of generation-rich distribution networks, and analytical techniques are developed for their quantification. A probability based analytical method has been developed using the joint probability of the demand and generation, and probability distributions of the proposed indices have been used to evaluate the network adequacy in energy supply and service continuation. A data clustering technique has been used to evaluate the joint probability between coincidental demand and renewable generation. Time sequential Monte Carlo simulation has been used to compare the results obtained using the proposed analytical method. A standard distribution network derived from Roy Billinton test system and a practical radial distribution network have been used to test the proposed method and demonstrate the estimation of the well-being of a system for hosting renewable DG units. It is found that renewable DG systems improve the 'energy supply' and 'continuity of service' in the distribution networks.

This paper describes the development of two types of numerical energy models which are able to predict the United States' future industrial energy-demand. One model uses an ANN (artificial neural network) technique, and the other model uses a MLR (multiple linear regression) technique. Various independent variables (GDP, price of energy carriers) are tested. The future industrial energy demand can then be forecasted based on a defined scenario.The ANN model anticipates a 16% increase in energy demand from 2012 by 2030. In this forecast, the model assumes that the effective independent parameters remain constant during this period and only GDP grows with a second-order polynomial trend.

In literature, the number of pump switches and the accumulative operation time of individual pumps are barely considered in the operation optimization of pump stations. In this paper, we integrate the two issues into the general optimal control (GOC) problem of pumping stations to form an optimal control problem with consideration of pump switches (OCPS) and an optimal control problem with consideration of accumulative operating time (OCOT), respectively. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is employed to solve the newly formulated problems. An intake pump station is taken as a case study. GOC, OCPS, OCOT and a hybrid of OCPS and OCOT (OCPS + OCOT) are applied to the station for simulation study. The results show that the optimal control approaches have the ability to achieve both energy efficiency and LS. Nearly 30% energy cost savings can be obtained by the optimal control approaches.

Low river run-off and/or high water temperatures limit a plant's production capacity. This problem may intensify with climate change. Our study quantifies the impact of forced capacity reductions on market prices, production costs, consumer and producer surplus, as well as emissions by means of a bottom-up power generation system model. First, we simulate the German electricity spot market during the heat wave of 2006. Then we conduct a sensitivity study that accounts for future climatic and technological conditions. We find an average price increase of 11% during the heat wave 2006, which is even more pronounced during times of peak demand. Production costs accumulate to an additional but moderate 16. m. Due to the price increase, producers gain from the heat wave, whereas consumers disproportionately bear the costs. Carbon emissions in the German electricity sector increase during the heat wave. The price and cost effects are more pronounced and increase significantly if assumptions on heat-sensitive demand, hydropower capacity, net exports, and capacity reductions are tightened. These are potential additional effects of climate change. Hence, if mitigation fails or is postponed globally, the impacts on the current energy system are very likely to rise. Increases in feed-in from renewable resources and demand-side management can counter the effects to a considerable degree.

Conceptually, as these industries grow, some proportion of their electrical output is 're-invested' to support manufacture and deployment of new generation capacity. As variable and intermittent, renewable generation capacity increases grid penetration, electrical energy storage will become an ever more important load-balancing technology. These storage technologies are currently expensive and energy intensive to deploy. We explore the impact on net energy production when wind and PV must 'pay' the energetic cost of storage deployment.

The results show that both on-shore and off-shore wind can support the deployment of a very large amount of storage, over 300 hours of geologic storage in the case of on-shore wind.

Simulation has been implemented in a medium voltage interconnected test network with a substation controller and a network simulator. The control actions successfully achieve the desired objectives and are evaluated in comparison analysis.

The motivation of such attention arises from the benefits that a smoother load profile brings to the management of power systems. This paper illustrates an approach to the peak shaving problem that leverages the real-time scheduling discipline to coordinate the activation/deactivation of a set of loads. The real-time scheduling is an active research topic in the field of computing systems. The innovative idea proposed in this paper is to apply existing real-time scheduling algorithms and analysis methods to the management of power loads. This solution requires an adequate modeling of considered devices in order to derive a representation in terms of timing parameters. The modeling approach enables the handling of a set of heterogeneous loads in a coordinated manner. In particular, this paper focuses on the modeling and management of household appliances. For this purpose, a set of the most common appliances is modeled and their activation is controlled by the proposed scheduling policy. Realistic assumptions are made on the daily usage of each device. The derived results show an effective and predicable reduction of the peak load while guaranteeing the user comfort associated with the load operation. The peak load of a single apartment is reduced by the 8% in the average case and by the 41% w.r.t. the worst-case. Considering the coalition of several apartments, the scheduling approach achieves a peak load reduction up to 46%. \u00a9 2014 Elsevier B.V.", "2014"]

In this paper, we propose a novel load shaping strategy based on energy storage and dynamic pricing in smart grid. In the proposed strategy, a consumer is encouraged to draw a certain amount of energy (i.e., quota) from the grid. When the actual energy demand is deviated from the quota, the consumer is faced with a higher electricity price. With the help of energy storage, the consumer can draw less electricity from the grid at a lower price by discharging energy when the demand is higher than the quota and draw more electricity from the grid at a lower price by charging energy when the demand is lower than the quota. As a result, the utility can implement load shaping and consumers can save energy cost simultaneously. Moreover, the proposed strategy can be implemented with low complexity and in a distributed fashion, which offers scalability to large number of consumers. Simulations results show the effectiveness of the proposed load shaping strategy. \u00a9 2014 IEEE.", "2014"]

This uncertainty is a challenge in the design and operation of electrical systems that include photovoltaic generation. Demand-Side Management (DSM) techniques are widely used to modify energy consumption. If local photovoltaic generation is available, DSM techniques can use generation forecast to schedule the local consumption. On the other hand, local storage systems can be used to separate electricity availability from instantaneous generation; therefore, the effects of forecast error in the electrical system are reduced. The effects of uncertainty associated to the forecast of photovoltaic generation in a residential electrical system equipped with DSM techniques and a local storage system are analyzed in this paper. The study has been performed in a solar house that is able to displace a residential user's load pattern, manage local storage and estimate forecasts of electricity generation. A series of real experiments and simulations have carried out on the house. The results of this experiments show that the use of Demand Side Management (DSM) and local storage reduces to 2% the uncertainty on the energy exchanged with the grid.

A linear, cost-minimising, dispatch model that includes a DC load-flow description of the transmission system and a general representation of load shifting is used. It is assumed that the EU Member States fulfil the targets for Year 2020 in their national renewable energy action plans. In the model calculations, a reference case without load shifting is compared with cases in which the load shifting is 5%, 10%, 15% or 20% of the load. The possibility to shift load in time is added exogenously and economic incentives for DSM are not evaluated. Three types of congestion are identified: peak-load-hour congestion, low-load-hour congestion and all-hour congestion. Peak-load-hour congestion is reduced as the DSM share of the load increases, whereas low-load-hour congestion, which is typically associated with a high level of wind generation, persists at all the DSM penetration levels investigated. We show that all-hour congestion occurs between systems that have large differences in supply structure, and that the impact of DSM on all-hour congestion is low. \u00a9 2014 Elsevier Ltd.", "2014"]

The results indicated high concentrations of bacteria in the water and biofilm. Microbial concentrations remained high in spite of the application of seven hours of heating during off-peak hours. Further numerical and experimental work shows that this problem arises due to the differing modes of heat transfer that prevail above and below the immersion element. The results from thermal and bacterial growth models suggest that it is impossible to achieve sanitary conditions throughout standard domestic hot water tanks without significantly increasing the heating element temperature or lowering the heating element from its current position. Raising the immersion thermostat temperature results in additional heat losses whilst lowering the immersion position compromises thermal stratification leading to uneconomical operation. Guidelines around storing hot water at temperatures that are sufficient for the purposes of sterilizing human pathogens such as Legionella, fail to take account of the conflict between thermal and sanitary performance. By better understanding the distribution of temperatures and bacteria within hot water tanks along with the associated risks, improved design and control strategies may be adopted to facilitate effective demand side management of hot water systems whilst meeting sanitary requirements. \u00a9 2014 The Authors.", "2014"]

We apply recent insights from the Global Energy Assessment, particularly the idea of vital energy systems, and the securitization theory to propose a framework for explaining China's energy security policies in their historic evolution.

We demonstrate that China's focus on vulnerabilities of its oil supply chain at the expense of improving the reliability of domestic electricity supply is not accidental. It has its roots in historic events, properties of energy systems, as well as the presence of powerful institutional agents interested in securitizing the oil supply chain but not other vital energy systems.

The data used is drawn from focus groups with 72 participants, using novel scenario techniques to contextualise smart grid technologies in domestic settings.

We propose that smart grid designs must look beyond simply the technology and recognise that a smart user who is actively engaged with energy is critical to much of what is proposed by demand side management.

One such application is the matching of PV production and household energy demand. Short-time peaks in PV generation and demand load produce errors in the matching results. The goal of the investigation is to show the reasons for these errors and to find out how large the errors are. The approach is partly theoretical and partly based on simulation exercises with TRNSYS using a time-resolution ranging from 1. min to 1. h.

In this paper, we undertake a decomposition analysis of changes in energy use by Chinese households for five energy-using activities: space heating/cooling, cooking, lighting and electric appliances. We investigate to what extent changes in energy use are due to changes from appliances and to change in floor space, population and energy mix. Our decomposition analysis is based on the logarithmic mean Divisia index technique using data from the China statistical yearbook and China energy statistical yearbook in the period of 2002-2010. According to our results, the increase in energy-using appliances is the biggest contributor to the increase of residential energy consumption during 2002-2010 but the effect declines over time, due to energy efficiency improvements in those appliances. The second most important contributor is floor space per capita, which increased with 28%. Of the four factors, population is the most stable factor and energy mix is the least important factor. We predicted electricity use, with the help of regression-based predictions for ownership of appliances and the energy efficiency of appliances. We found that electricity use will continue to rise despite a gradual saturation of demand. \u00a9 2014 Elsevier Ltd.", "2014"]

As demand for electricity continues to grow, maintaining a balanced power system at all times has become more challenging in Korea and other developed nations. Along with demand response programs and increased renewable energy utilization, energy storage devices may provide a viable way to contribute to diurnal peak demand shaving. In some parts of the U.S. storage arbitrage has proven to be profitable. Treating a battery's ability to charge and discharge as a scarce resource, we apply the Hotelling (1931) rule to determine a strategy for maximizing the value of the battery. Results show that present market conditions in South Korea do not provide sufficient economic incentives for energy arbitrage using sodium-sulfur (NaS) or lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries, with the capital cost of the storage devices exceeding potential revenues. \u00a9 2014.", "2014"]

DSM is increasingly moving to the forefront of the energy policy agenda in many countries due to objectives for energy security, affordability and carbon emissions reduction. However, the policy side of DSM has been little explored in the literature, and the paper proposes how the method of systematic reviews can be applied to the energy policy field. Systematic reviews are commonly used in the medical sciences and are beginning to be applied to social science disciplines. The realist synthesis approach is utilised to determine not only impacts, but to analyse how and why policies are successful, and how contextual factors, such as market structure and regulatory environment, influence their success. A study quality assessment scale is proposed to appraise the quality of studies in determining what documents are included in the review. Systematic reviews are an effective method for collating the results of all the previous studies that have been done on a given programme, and it has an important and useful role for improving the evidence base for informing energy policy. The paper focuses on evaluating the method, discusses the case for realist synthesis to overcome issues of establishing how and why DSM policies work or fail and gives an example from ongoing research into how it can be applied to analyse DSM policy. \u00a9 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.", "2014"]

Method: EUPowerDispatch, a minimum-cost unit commitment dispatch model, is used to compare the impacts of controlled EV charging and cross-border transmission for different levels of variable renewable energy sources penetration in two case studies: a conceptual two-node system and the European power system. Results: Results show how both controlled EV charging and cross-border transmission capacity reduce electricity dispatch costs, curtailment of variable renewable energy sources (RES), storing energy by utilising pumped hydro, and unserved load. The paper shows that when the demand for arbitrage is low, controlled EV charging can substitute for a certain volume of cross-border transmission capacity. When demand for arbitrage becomes higher due to higher volumes of RES, the two increasingly complement one another with respect to reducing dispatch costs. The main reason for this is that cross-border transmission capacity is needed to transport power to where electric vehicles can absorb it. Conclusion: Demand response, in this case EV charging control, is not only a competitor of cross-border electricity transmission. In the presence of a high volume of RES, they can complement one another. Practical implications: The study presented in this paper provides insights about potential investment decisions that Europe will have to face in order to meet the decarbonisation goals set by the European Commission by 2050. Transmission planners should take into consideration that while demand response and cross-border transmission capacity may substitute each other at a limited share of intermittent renewable energy, at a higher share their interactions become more complex as their benefits become dependent on each other. \u00a9 2013 Elsevier Ltd.", "2014"]

The estimated price elasticity is close to unit elasticity and increases as income grows, and income elasticity is low and positive and approximates to zero as income increases. Thus, we conclude that it might be effective by using pricing policies for demand-side management to adjust the electricity consumption of high-income groups, while increasing price will severely hit low-income groups. In addition, low-income groups will consume more electricity if their income increases. This suggests that while tariff reform is necessary, supporting policies are needed. In this regard, either directly subsidizing low-income families or rationally setting the price levels of different tariff blocks can be helpful.", "2013"]

The proposed stochastic model schedules energy and reserves provided by both of generating units and responsive loads in power systems with high penetration of wind power. This model is formulated as a two-stage stochastic programming, where first-stage is associated with electricity market, its rules and constraints and the second-stage is related to actual operation of the power system and its physical limitations in each scenario. The discrete retail customer responses to incentive-based DR programs are aggregated by DRPs (Demand Response Providers) and are submitted as a load change price and amount offer package to ISO (Independent System Operator). Also, price-based DR program behavior and random nature of wind power are modeled by price elasticity concept of the demand and normal probability distribution function, respectively. In the proposed model, DRPs can participate in energy market as well as reserve market and submit their offers to the wholesale electricity market. This approach is implemented on a modified IEEE 30-bus test system over a daily time horizon. The simulation results are analyzed in six different case studies. The cost, emission and multiobjective functions are optimized in both without and with DR cases.

Korea and Mongolia show clear differences in electricity-generation structure related to import dependency, the potential of renewable energy, and threats to energy security. These variations lead to different decisions on the power-generation fuel mix plan. Use of fossil fuel resources in Korea results in carbon dioxide emissions and energy insecurity, while in Mongolia carbon emissions, also from fossil fuels, and energy insecurity are separate concerns as Mongolia domestically operates coal-fired power plants and imports electricity. Policies targeting two objectives, carbon emissions mitigation and energy security improvement, show complementarity in Korea as fossil fuels are replaced by renewables or nuclear power, but represent trade-offs in Mongolia as emissions mitigation and improved energy security cannot be achieved with one strategy. In conclusion, national plans to achieve two goals differ by country: In Korea, the appropriate portion of nuclear energy is the determining policy factor.

Although there is definite potential for demand-side management on these systems, it is critical that the service delivery be maintained so as not to adversely affect productivity. An energy saving strategy based on variable water flow was developed for the unique demands of integrated mine cooling systems. The strategy is based on matching the evaporators with the demand of chilled water; condensers adapting to the heat load; and the bulk air cooler matching the demand of ventilation air requirements. In this paper, a case study is presented in which the savings and consequences of implementing the developed energy saving strategy are investigated.

Backup units (battery/supercapacitor) are also needed for uninterrupted energy.

During the last decade several new techniques are being used for energy demand management to accurately predict the future energy needs. In this paper an attempt is made to review the various energy demand forecasting models. Traditional methods such as time series, regression, econometric, ARIMA as well as soft computing techniques such as fuzzy logic, genetic algorithm, and neural networks are being extensively used for demand side management.

On average, 73.1% of all residential units in the country are equipped with these resistance-heating devices, with nominal powers ranging from 3 to 8. kW. This situation imposes a considerable burden on the electricity utility companies, since electrical showerheads typically represent the highest load but the lowest utilization (load factor) in a residential consumer unit. Furthermore, typical utilization times coincide with, and contribute to, the electrical power demand peaks in Brazil, rendering these low-cost, high-power electrical devices a high-cost consumer for the electrical system to cater for. For low-income residential consumers, electricity tariffs are subsidized, and utilities must therefore make a considerable investment in infrastructure for a limited return. In this paper we analyze the impacts of solar water heating in low-income households on the distribution utility active, reactive and apparent power demands. We have monitored a statistically representative group of low-income residences equipped with a compact domestic solar water heater in Florianopolis - Brazil for 1. year.

The day-ahead load shifting technique proposed in this paper is mathematically formulated as a minimization problem. A heuristic-based Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) that easily adapts heuristics in the problem was developed for solving this minimization problem. Simulations were carried out on a smart grid which contains a variety of loads in three service areas, one with residential customers, another with commercial customers, and the third one with industrial customers.

Energy consumption in transportation sector has also been dominated by road transport due to limited coverage by rail and water transportation. Hence, road transport has been a major contributor for greenhouse gas emission in Thailand over recent years. Along with global warming concern throughout the world, Thailand has taken various adaptation and mitigation measures, especially the strong policy push to use carbon-neutral biofuel in transportation sector due to Thailand competitive advantage in agriculture sector. National Renewable Energy Plan (2008-2022) has set challenging targets of 9 and 4.5 million liters/day of ethanol and biodiesel consumption by 2022, respectively. Various blends of ethanol in gasoline (10%, 20% and 85%) and biodiesel in diesel (up to 5%) have been commercially available. However, since current consumption of diesel is twice as much of gasoline, ethanol blend in gasoline would widen the imbalance consumption of gasoline and diesel. The present study however offers an insight into a possibility to use ethanol as diesel substitute. A case study of ethanol bus technology was investigated by recourse to energy demand modeling. Necessary data, such as a number of vehicles (NVs) for various vehicle types, vehicle kilometer of travel (VKT) and fuel economy (FE) were collected, with reasonable assumptions made for those unavailable data, to construct predicative energy demand model. Scenario analysis on ethanol bus introduction was conducted to assess reduction of fossil fuel and greenhouse gas emission by increasing the use of ethanol to achieve ethanol consumption target in 2022.

We use the state of Delhi as a case study. We estimate that by 2015, the electric utilities in Delhi can potentially save nearly 14% of total sales. We examine the impacts on utility finances and consumer tariffs by developing scenarios that account for variations in the following factors: (a) incentive mechanisms for mitigating the financial risk of utilities, (b) whether utilities fund the EE programs only partially, (c) whether utilities sell the conserved electricity into spot markets and (d) the level of power shortages utilities are facing. We find that average consumer tariff would increase by 2.2% although consumers participating in EE programs benefit from reduction in their electricity consumption. While utility incentive mechanisms can mitigate utilities' risk of losing long-run returns, they cannot address the risk of consistently negative cash flow. In case of power shortages, the cash flow risk is amplified (reaching up to 57% of utilities annual returns) and is very sensitive to marginal tariffs of consumers facing power shortages.

Model results suggest: If load increases as anticipated at 1.4%/year, BC will need to import significant amounts of electricity within two decades. Operating the Burrard plant at full capacity to 2025 and bringing Site C on line in 2020 delays the need to import by only 6 years, while realizing net electricity export sales of $5.9 billion by 2040. Bringing Site C on line but imposing a tax of $30/t of CO2 emitted on gas-fired generation causes immediate closure of the Burrard plant on economic grounds and reduces net export revenue to $0.63 billion by 2040.

Spatial analysis highlighted that EV owners would not be evenly distributed throughout the city, and the initial stages of a proposed LRT network would cover only a limited area. Therefore, a few local power substations would have to provide the majority of additional power for both electric transport modes. Without management of EV charging patterns, one of the local substations would be overloaded if more than 2.6% of the Christchurch light vehicle fleet were EVs. The power demand from a LRT system would not overload the local grid given current demand levels. However several substations would need an upgrade 4 years earlier than current plans. A comparative analysis shows that despite the power demand from an EV fleet being higher than the demand from a LRT system (on a equal passenger kilometre per day basis), demand side management methods would allow shifting EV charging off peak time whereas a LRT system would still contribute significantly more to peak load. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier Ltd.", "2012"]

As the percentage of electricity supply from these sources increases, grid operators will need to employ strategies and technologies, including energy storage, to balance supply with demand. We quantify energy and material resource requirements for currently available energy storage technologies: lithium ion (Li-ion), sodium sulfur (NaS) and lead-acid (PbA) batteries; vanadium redox (VRB) and zinc-bromine (ZnBr) flow batteries; and geologic pumped hydroelectric storage (PHS) and compressed air energy storage (CAES). By introducing new concepts, including energy stored on invested (ESOI), we map research avenues that could expedite the development and deployment of grid-scale energy storage. ESOI incorporates several storage attributes instead of isolated properties, like efficiency or energy density. Calculations indicate that electrochemical storage technologies will impinge on global energy supplies for scale up - PHS and CAES are less energy intensive by 100 fold. Using ESOI we show that an increase in electrochemical storage cycle life by tenfold would greatly relax energetic constraints for grid-storage and improve cost competitiveness. We find that annual material resource production places tight limits on Li-ion, VRB and PHS development and loose limits on NaS and CAES. This analysis indicates that energy storage could provide some grid flexibility but its build up will require decades. Reducing financial cost is not sufficient for creating a scalable energy storage infrastructure. Most importantly, for grid integrated storage, cycle life must be improved to improve the scalability of battery technologies. As a result of the constraints on energy storage described here, increasing grid flexibility as the penetration of renewable power generation increases will require employing several additional techniques including demand-side management, flexible generation from base-load facilities and natural gas firming. \u00a9  The Royal Society of Chemistry 2013.", "2013"]

In addition, smart pricing can be used to seek social benefits and to implement social objectives. To achieve social objectives, the utility company may need to collect various information about users and their energy consumption behavior, which can be challenging. In this paper, we propose an efficient pricing method to tackle this problem. We assume that each user is equipped with an energy consumption controller (ECC) as part of its smart meter. All smart meters are connected to not only the power grid but also a communication infrastructure. This allows two-way communication among smart meters and the utility company. We analytically model each user's preferences and energy consumption patterns in form of a utility function. Based on this model, we propose a Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism which aims to maximize the social welfare, i.e., the aggregate utility functions of all users minus the total energy cost. Our design requires that each user provides some information about its energy demand. In return, the energy provider will determine each user's electricity bill payment. Finally, we verify some important properties of our proposed VCG mechanism for demand side management such as efficiency, user truthfulness, and nonnegative transfer. Simulation results confirm that the proposed pricing method can benefit both users and utility companies. \u00a9 2010-2012 IEEE.", "2012"]

In this paper, a new demand side management technique, namely, a new energy efficient scheduling algorithm, is proposed to arrange the household appliances for operation such that the monetary expense of a customer is minimized based on the time-varying pricing model. The proposed algorithm takes into account the uncertainties in household appliance operation time and intermittent renewable generation. Moreover, it considers the variable frequency drive and capacity-limited energy storage. Our technique first uses the linear programming to efficiently compute a deterministic scheduling solution without considering uncertainties. To handle the uncertainties in household appliance operation time and energy consumption, a stochastic scheduling technique, which involves an energy consumption adaptation variable \u03b2, is used to model the stochastic energy consumption patterns for various household appliances. To handle the intermittent behavior of the energy generated from the renewable resources, the offline static operation schedule is adapted to the runtime dynamic scheduling considering variations in renewable energy. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Compared to a traditional scheduling scheme which models typical household appliance operations in the traditional home scenario, the proposed deterministic linear programming based scheduling scheme achieves up to 45% monetary expense reduction, and the proposed stochastic design scheme achieves up to 41% monetary expense reduction. Compared to a worst case design where an appliance is assumed to consume the maximum amount of energy, the proposed stochastic design which considers the stochastic energy consumption patterns achieves up to 24% monetary expense reduction without violating the target trip rate of 0.5%. Furthermore, the proposed energy consumption scheduling algorithm can always generate the scheduling solution within 10 seconds, which is fast enough for household appliance applications. \u00a9 2010-2012 IEEE.", "2013"]

The first load type must consume a specified amount of energy over the scheduling horizon, but the consumption can be adjusted across different slots. The second type does not entail a total energy requirement, but operation away from a user-specified level results in user dissatisfaction.

The refrigeration plants, together with the underground water supply and dewatering systems are integrated to form one complete water reticulation system. This integrated water reticulation system extracts hot water from the mine, cools it down and returns the cold water to the various underground mining levels. As much as 42% of the total energy consumption on a typical deep level gold mine can be ascribed to the water reticulation system. Reducing the overall water demand and therefore electricity costs will depend on climatic conditions, operating strategy, water reservoir capacity, and electricity tariff rates.

This model minimises the total operating cost of the water reticulation system by a trade-off between the cost involved in providing effective pump control and the savings achieved under a specified electricity tariff.

The proposed market-based mechanism allows the SMO to control the behavior of internal loads through price signals and to provide feedback to the ISO. A regulation service reserves quantity is transacted between the SMO and the ISO for a relatively long period of time (e.g., a one-hour-long time-scale). During this period the ISO follows shorter time-scale stochastic dynamics to repeatedly request from the SMO to decrease or increase its consumption. We model the operational task of selecting an optimal short time-scale dynamic pricing policy as a stochastic dynamic program that maximizes average SMO and ISO utility. We then formulate an associated nonlinear programming static problem that provides an upper bound on the optimal utility. We study an asymptotic regime in which this upper bound is shown to be tight and the static policy provides an efficient approximation of the dynamic pricing policy. Equally importantly, this framework allows us to optimize the long time-scale decision of determining the optimal regulation service reserve quantity.

The present study estimates the potential of demand-side management efficiency improvement targeted at (1) short-term efficiency improvement (agricultural pump rectification) that can provide immediate relief, and (2) long-term efficiency improvement (appliance standards such as AC and refrigerator, new agricultural pump purchase and pump replacement) for Gujarat state in India. The methodology includes the calculation of cost of conserved energy for each technology, which works out to be (-1.18)US$ cents/kWh for new agriculture pump sets, 1.03US$ cents/kWh for refrigerators and 5.21US$ cents/kWh for air conditioners. The price of power varies around 1.13US$ cents to 12.1cents/kWh in Gujarat. The annual energy savings from the selected energy-efficient technologies are approximately 8767GWh over a period of 10yr, while the estimated peak power savings are about 1814MW, large enough to eliminate one-fourth of the state's electricity shortages.

Moreover, climatic concerns force power system appliers to utilize these systems more environmental friendly. To obtain the mentioned aims, MGs (microgrids) act as key solutions. MGs are invented not only to operate power systems more reliable and efficient but also to penetrate CHP (combined heat and power)-based DG (distributed generation) into power systems with an optimal control on their generation. This paper presents a new optimal operation of a CHP-based MG comprising ESS (energy storage system), three types of thermal power generation units, and DRPs (demand response programs). In this paper, DRPs are treated as virtual generation units along with all of realization constraints. In a multi-objective self-scheduling optimization problem of a MG, the first objective deals with minimizing total operational cost of the CHP-MG in an OPF-based formulation and the second refers to the emission minimization of DGs.

Given a programmable household appliance switching system, and user-reported appliance use times, we simulated the load reduction effectiveness of three types of algorithms, which were applied at both the single household level and across all 30 households. All three algorithms effected significant load reductions, while the least-to-highest potential user inconvenience ranking was: coordinating the timing of frequent intermittent loads (algorithm 2); moving period-of-day time-flexible loads to off-peak times (algorithm 1); and applying short-term time delays to avoid high peaks (algorithm 3) (least accommodating). Peak reduction was facilitated by load interruptibility, time of use flexibility and the willingness of users to forgo impulsive appliance use. We conclude that a general factor determining the ability to shift the load due to a particular appliance is the time-buffering between the service delivered and the power demand of an appliance. Time-buffering can be 'technologically inherent', due to human habits, or realised by managing user expectations.

Uncontrolled or unscheduled vehicle charging may increase the residential peak and the risk of electric distribution network failure. In order to reduce the peak load utility companies encourage customers who have such high electricity consuming devices to participate in various demand response (DR) programs. Additionally, considering increasing Photovoltaic (PV) generation and storage facility installation on customer side, the integration of PHEVs needs more attention as system's performance becomes highly fluctuating and unpredictable. This paper presents a simulation based optimization framework for integrated analysis of demand response programs, with high penetration of PHEV and PV and storage systems from residential customer's perspective as well as utility company's perspective. An agent-based simulation model is built in AnyLogic to mimic the household load, PHEV charging, PV generation and storage together with various demand response programs such as time-of-use (TOU), Real-time Pricing (RTP), and curtailment. In the considered scenarios, customers schedule their PHEV charging time and duration to minimize the electricity bill considering the price at the time of use, while the utility company aims to minimize the peak due to the PHEV charging by changing prices. The constructed simulation helps the utility company identify the best policies, and helps customers make better response under different DR programs. Three demand response programs are simulated with and without PV and storage.

To achieve sustainable development, China has to consider how to promote energy efficiency to meet the demand of Chinese rapid economic growth, as the energy efficiency of China is relatively low. Meanwhile, the appeal of energy saving and emission reduction has been made by the Chinese central government. Therefore, it is important to evaluate the energy efficiency of industrial sector in China and to assess efficiency development probabilities. The framework of total factor energy efficiency index is adopted to determine the discrepancy of energy efficiency in Chinese industrial sector based on the provincial statistical data of industrial enterprises above designated size in 30 provinces from 2005 to 2009, with gross industrial output as the output value and energy consumption, average remaining balance of capital assets and average amount of working force as the input values. Besides, in considerate of the regional divide of China, namely eastern, central, and western, and economic development differences in each region, energy efficiency of each region is also analysed in this paper. The results show that there is room for China to improve its energy efficiency, especially western provinces which have large amount of energy input excess.

This kind of plant is aiming to overcome some of the major limitations of renewable energy sources, represented by their low power density and intermittent nature, largely depending upon local site and unpredictable weather conditions. In CAES, energy is stored in the form of compressed air in a reservoir during off-peak periods, while it is used on demand during peak periods to generate power with a turbo-generator system.

Simulation results confirm that the proposed energy consumption scheduling algorithm can benefit both users, by reducing their energy expenses, and utility companies, by improving the peak-to-average ratio of the aggregate load demand. \u00a9 2010-2012 IEEE.", "2013"]

A number of variants of the vehicle-to-grid theme have been proposed and prototypes have proven that the technological means to deliver many of these are available. This study reviews the most popular variants and investigates their viability using Western Australia, the smallest wholesale electricity market in the world, as an extreme test case. Geographical and electrical isolation prevents the trade of energy and ancillary services with neighbouring regions and the flat landscape prohibits hydroelectric storage. Hot summers and the widespread use of air-conditioning means that peak energy demand is a growing issue, and the ongoing addition to already underutilised generation and transmission capacity is unsustainable. The report concludes that most variants of vehicle-to-grid currently require too much additional infrastructure investment, carry significant risk and are currently too costly to implement in the light of alternative options. Charging electric vehicles can, however, be added to planned demand side management schemes without the need for additional capital investment. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier Ltd.", "2012"]

There are severe supply side constraints in term of coal and gas shortages that are likely to continue in the near future. Hence, in its current focus to solving the energy shortage problem and sustaining the development trajectory, the country should aim at a balance between supply side and demand side measures. Energy Efficiency in end use is increasingly gaining importance as one of the most cost effective options for achieving short to medium term energy savings. India has initiated the National Mission for Enhanced Energy Efficiency under National Action Plan for Climate Change which addresses various aspects of energy efficiency such as technology, financing, fiscal incentive and also creation of energy efficiency as a market instrument. However, even though energy efficiency has substantial scope in the Indian subcontinent, the market for energy efficiency has been limited. This paper discusses the concept of mega Demand Side Management projects as a DSM Power Plant. A DSM Power Plant acts as an umbrella with multiple energy efficiency schemes under its ambit aimed at transforming energy efficiency into a business by providing a push to the scale of operation as well as financial sustenance to energy efficiency projects. This paper expounds on the various aspects of DSM Power Plant in terms of its policy and institutional mechanism for the large scale implementation of energy efficiency in India. This paper provides an illustration of the concept of DSM Power Plant model through a case study in one of the states (Rajasthan) of India. Further, a comparative analysis of the cost of generation from DSM Power Plant and a representative conventional power plant (CPP) in Rajasthan has been undertaken and the DSM Power Plant comes out to be a more cost effective option. The concept of DSM Power Plant will not only address the issue of energy shortages but will also help the financially thwarted utilities to reduce their revenue deficit in the near future. \u00a9 2013 Elsevier Ltd.", "2013"]

This paper develops the proposed method, and verifies it using high-resolution end-use data from twelve households with known characteristics. We then apply the method to hourly whole-house (smart meter) data from 327 households in Ontario. The roll-out of smart (advanced) metering infrastructure in many countries will make hourly whole-house data abundant, and we propose that this method could be widely applied by utilities to target their demand-side management programs towards households more likely to provide benefits, thus increasing the cost-effectiveness of such programs. \u00a9 2012 NRC Canada.", "2012"]

This has led to the extensive use of peak load plants and thus to higher costs for the whole system. Wind energy represents a strongly increasing percentage of overall electricity production, but wind normally does not follow the typical demand profile. As generation flexibility is limited due to technical restrictions, and in absence of large energy storages, the other side of the equilibrium generation-demand has to react. Demand side management measures intend to adapt the demand profile to the situation in the system. In this paper, the operation of an electric system with high wind penetration is modeled by means of a unit commitment problem. Demand shifting and peak shaving are considered in this operation problem. Demand shifting is modeled in two different ways. Firstly, the system operator controls the shift of demand; secondly, each consumer decides its reaction to prices depending on its elasticity. The model is applied to the isolated power system of Gran Canaria. The impact of an increased installed wind capacity on operation and the cost savings resulting from the introduction of responsive demand are assessed.

Optimization of energy planning is therefore, key to achieving the overall planning goals. The hierarchical multi-objective policy optimization is a policy-centric multi-level bottom-up iterative approach, designed from a developing country perspective, utilizing the optimality principle of dynamic programming. It is applied to the Indian power sector by grouping the strategies into three portfolios, namely, power generation mix, demand side efficiency group and supply side efficiency group. Each portfolio is optimized taking into account the objectives of cost minimization and comprehensive risk and barrier reduction. The portfolios are further combined and optimized at a higher level with respect to higher level objectives, namely, economic growth, energy equity, energy security and climate sustainability. This paper focuses on the second level optimization utilizing data envelopment analysis (DEA). Both the deterministic and stochastic variations have been analysed and the results compared in respect of unrestricted as well as restricted weight models.

China's electricity system currently lacks the flexibility in planning, operations, and pricing to respond to conflicting pressures from demand growth, rising costs, and environmental mandates in a way that simultaneously maintains reliability, decarbonizes the system, and keeps prices within acceptable bounds. Greater flexibility crucially requires the ability to more systematically and transparently manage and allocate costs. This will require re-orientating sector institutions still rooted in central planning, and strengthening independent regulation. Some of the necessary changes require fundamental political and legal reforms beyond the scope of energy policy. However, the system's flexibility can still be increased through the development of traditional planning and regulatory tools and approaches, such as an avoided cost basis for energy efficiency investments, more integrated planning to improve the coordination of generation, transmission, and demand-side investments, and a transparent ratemaking process.

These needs can include power, fuel for transportation in the form of hydrogen, potable water through desalination and space heating and cooling.

Further research has taken place in the supervisory management of this topology using computational intelligence techniques like fuzzy logic, which has optimized the concept minimizing the sizes of the installed components. The optimal design of the system can meet, though, only the design principles and needs. In reality experience has shown that most autonomous power systems operate out of specifications very shortly after installation or after a couple of years new needs arise and it is not possible economic wise for the people to extend it. In these cases the microgrid would struggle to cover the increased needs and in the end fail, causing blackouts. A solution to this is partial load shedding in an intelligent manner.

Denmark is used as a case as the country has a high share of district heating and produces 20% of the electricity with wind power. The analyses are carried out using the electricity market model Balmorel, which facilitates cost optimization of operation and investments in energy production plants as well as electricity transmission. To be able to perform the analysis an extension of the model is developed, where it is also possible to optimize between investments in individual heating plants or in expansion of the district heating networks, depending on investment costs, energy density of the potential areas and their distance to existing district heating networks. Results show that district heating may contribute to the sustainability and security of supply of future energy systems and that under the given assumptions it is cost effective to increase the share of district heating up to 55-57% of the heat demand although substantial heat saving measures are installed. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier Ltd.", "2012"]

We focus on a smart grid in which the demand-side comprises traditional users as well as users owning some kind of distributed energy sources and/or energy storage devices. By means of a day-ahead optimization process regulated by an independent central unit, the latter users intend to reduce their monetary energy expense by producing or storing energy rather than just purchasing their energy needs from the grid. In this paper, we formulate the resulting grid optimization problem as a noncooperative game and analyze the existence of optimal strategies. Furthermore, we present a distributed algorithm to be run on the users' smart meters, which provides the optimal production and/or storage strategies, while preserving the privacy of the users and minimizing the required signaling with the central unit.

Cooling systems on South African mines have been identified as large electricity consumers. There is significant potential for energy efficiency improvement by the widespread introduction of variable speed drive (VSD) technology. An energy audit was conducted on 20 large mine cooling systems and potential savings and feasibility indicators were calculated. A pilot implementation study was also done on one mine to experimentally validate the estimated savings. In this paper, the results of the audit, the potential savings and the pilot study results are presented. It is shown that large-scale implementation of VSDs on mine cooling system pumps and fans is economically viable. A total annual electrical energy saving of 144,721MWh, or 32.2%, can be achieved. An annual cost saving of US$6,938,148 and CO2 emissions reduction of 132Mton is possible. The implementation of VSDs on mine chiller compressors will also result in large energy savings, but is not economically feasible at present.

The proposed operational strategy is mainly focused on generation scheduling and demand side management. In generation scheduling, schedule coordinator agent executes a two-stage scheduling: day-ahead and real-time scheduling. The day-ahead scheduling finds out hourly power settings of distributed energy resources (DERs) from a day-ahead energy market. The real-time scheduling updates the power settings of the distributed energy resources by considering the results of the day-ahead scheduling and feedback from real-time operation of the microgrid in real-time digital simulator (RTDS). A demand side management agent performs load shifting before the day-ahead scheduling, and does load curtailing in real-time whenever it is necessary and possible. The distributed multiagent model proposed in this paper provides a common communication interface for all components of the microgrid to interact with one another for autonomous intelligent control actions. Furthermore, the multiagent system maximizes the power production of local distributed generators, minimizes the operational cost of the microgrid, and optimizes the power exchange between the main power grid and the microgrid subject to system constraints and constraints of distributed energy resources. Outcome of simulation studies demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed multiagent approach for real-time operation of a microgrid. \u00a9 2012 IEEE.", "2012"]

Turkey plans to supply 30% or 160,000 GWh of this demand from renewable energy sources according to the recently avowed government agenda Vision 2023. However, the current installed renewable energy capacity is around 60,000 GWh. Detailed literature analysis showed that only wind and solar energy potential in Turkey can solely supply this demand. In this study, two different scenarios were generated to analyse the cost and environmental impacts of supplying this demand. Scenario 1, which is derived from the official Vision 2023 targets, suggests supplying this demand from wind, solar, geothermal energy and hydropower. The total projected cost based on Scenario 1 is estimated to be $31.000 billion and annual greenhouse gas emissions of 1.05 million tonnes of CO 2 equivalent. According to Scenario 2 or the contrary setup it is assumed that the required demand gap could not be supplied from new renewable energy investments but equally from coal and natural gas. The projected cost is estimated to be around $8.000 billion and annual greenhouse gas emissions at appalling 71.30 million tonnes of CO 2 equivalent. Assuming carbon tax at the year 2023 to be $50 per tonne of CO 2 emitted, supplying the demand from renewable energy sources according to Scenario 1 would generate savings worth nearly $2.175 billion from environmental taxes annually.

Latent heat thermal energy storage (LHTES) is used to provide load shifted thermal energy at small temperature swing with high storage density, hence an overall more compact energy system. However, the low thermal conductivity of the majority of the phase change materials (PCMs) necessitates delicate design of the active storage unit to meet power demand (high enough energy extraction/storage per amount of time).A performance analysis of two LHTES configurations is carried out in this work. Thermal charge and discharge rate of single PCM is compared with multistage LHTES using a cascade design of multiple PCMs at various phase change temperatures in a submerged finned pipe heat exchanger design. The work is conducted with a validated finite element based numerical simulation for evaluation of both full charge/discharge cycle and continuous half charge/discharge cycles.The results show that in full charge/discharge mode, the thermal performance of a multi-PCM LHTES may be improved by 10-40% as compared to that of a homogeneous single-PCM storage unit in terms of thermal charge/discharge rate. This is due to the capability of the multistage LHTES to maintain a higher driving temperature difference for the heat transfer process in the charging and discharging processes. In half charge/discharge cycling mode, however, the thermal power rating performance of multi-PCM storage converges towards that of the single-PCM storage in melting process, reducing thus the multi-PCM enhancement.

The LP leverages PV power output and load forecasts to minimize peak loads subject to elementary dynamical and electrical constraints of the PV+ system. Battery charge/discharge were simulated over a range of two PV+ system parameters (battery storage capacity and peak load reduction target) to obtain energy cost for a time-of-use pricing schedule and the net present value (NPV) of the battery storage system. The financial benefits of our optimized energy dispatch schedule were compared with basic off-peak charging/on-peak discharging and real-time load response dispatch strategies that did not use any forecast information. The NPV of the battery array increased significantly when the battery was operated on the optimized schedule compared to the off-peak/on-peak and real time dispatch schedules. These trends were attributed to increased battery lifetime and reduced demand charges attained under the optimized dispatch strategy.

This study therefore combined the following: a stochastic model to determine mobility behavior, an optimization model to minimize vehicle charging costs and an agent-based electricity market equilibrium model to estimate variable electricity prices. The variable electricity prices are calculated based on marginal generation costs.

As in a developing country context political considerations make tariff levels more important than supply security, satisfying the earmarked level of demand takes a back seat. Retail market regulators are often forced by politicians to keep the retail tariff at suboptimal level. This imposes budget constraint on distribution companies to procure electricity that it requires to meet the earmarked level of demand. This is the way demand response is introduced in the system and has its impact on spot market prices. We model such a situation of not being able to serve the earmarked demand as disutility to the regulator which has to be minimised and we compute associated equilibrium. This results in systematic mechanism for cutting loads. We find that even a small cut in ability of the distribution companies to procure electricity from the spot market has profound impact on the prices in the spot market. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier Ltd.", "2012"]

Residential demand response (RDR) can be treated as an energy resource which can be assessed and commercially developed. RDR prospectors require more detailed information about usage patterns and penetration for specific electrical appliances during system peak load. The electric utilities normally measure electricity consumption data aggregated over many households and other users on a feeder and do not have information on household end-use behaviour.

A unified framework is used to estimate the costs and benefits of the schemes implemented in Great Britain in 2002, in Italy in 2005 and in France in 2006. 'Negawatt-hour cost' estimates reach 0. 009\u20ac/kWh saved in Great Britain and 0.037\u20ac/kWh saved in France, which compares favourably to energy prices in those countries. Moreover, the benefits of reduced energy bills and CO 2 emissions saved exceed the costs; thus, white certificate schemes pay for themselves. Overall, the policy instrument is cost-effective and economically efficient. A closer look at the differences amongst countries provides general insights about the conceptualization of the instrument: (a) Compared to utility demand-side management, to which they are related, white certificate schemes provide more transparency about energy savings, but less transparency around costs; (b) the substantial efficiency discrepancy between the British scheme and its French counterpart can be explained by differences in technological potentials, coexisting policies and supply-side systems in these countries and (c) the nature and amount of costs influence compliance strategies.

The proposed load control scheme balances device- and grid-level objectives simultaneously, and is demonstrated for a system comprising a distributed responsive population of 14,000 residential-sized buildings integrated in a transmission system network consisting of six buses. Air-source heat pumps are implemented as the primary heating source in the responsive building population, and are introduced as a dispatchable grid-side energy resource, where aggregated output can be objectively ramped up or down through the use of an optimal centralized control strategy. A two step multi-objective optimization procedure is implemented to simultaneously satisfy balancing of the power system and customer objectives across a multi-scalar system. At the power system-level, the optimal preventive control scheme is obtained based on steady-state voltage stability constraints. At the customer-level, an optimal demand response strategy is proposed, wherein the aggregate power demand from a population of heat pumps is controlled to follow load-shedding requirements. The customer comfort is continuously maintained by constrained regulation of the thermal set-point governing operation of the heat pump device.The proposed demand-side strategy achieves similar goals to conventional approaches to regulation and spinning reserve ancillary services, but with the significant benefit of higher efficiencies. Under the proposed scheme, ancillary services provided by the electric loads effectively become virtual generators that enhance the voltage stability in power systems operating under increased uncertainty, and replace severe or multiple contingency reserves typically supplied by conventional generators. The proposed demand response control scheme can be extended to other potentially responsive end-use appliances, and opens avenues for increased exploitation of intermittent renewable energy resources while reducing operating costs and emissions. \u00a9 2011 Elsevier Ltd.", "2012"]

The welfare analysis is based on two alternative scenarios, a hypothetical percentage increase in the price of the commodity and a hypothetical percentage decrease in the amount of subsidy. The latter is considered to be a simultaneous problem in which the exact price of the commodity that reduces consumption, and subsequently the subsidy to the specific target level needs to be determined first. As a case study, the paper utilizes the most recent Household Expenditure Survey in the State of Kuwait to estimate residential electricity demand for different household groups (i.e., low-, middle-, and high-income), and employs a partial equilibrium model to measure the welfare implications that may result from a reduction in the electricity subsidy rates. The empirical findings show that a small increase in the price of electricity would reduce annual consumption by 4741. million. kWh and annual subsidy by US$734 million. The results also show that the loss in consumers' welfare is approximately US$145 million, while the financial and environmental benefits to the society ranges between US$658 million and US$889 million.

The recent national smart metering roll-out in the UK implies that this approach needs to be re-assessed since utilities will recover the capital costs associated with DSP technology through bills. This paper introduces a reward and penalty mechanism focusing on residential users. DSP planning costs are recovered through payments from those consumers who do not react to peak signals. Those consumers who do react are rewarded by paying lower bills. Because real-time incentives to residential consumers tend to fail due to the negligible amounts associated with net gains (and losses) for individual users, in the proposed mechanism the regulator determines benchmarks which are matched against responses to signals and caps the level of rewards/penalties to avoid market distortions. The paper presents an overview of existing financial incentive mechanisms for DSP; introduces the reward/penalty mechanism aimed at fostering DSP under the hypothesis of smart metering roll-out; considers the costs faced by utilities for DSP programs; assesses linear rate effects and value changes; introduces compensatory weights for those consumers who have physical or financial impediments; and shows findings based on simulation runs on three discrete levels of elasticity.

Existing models do not capture developing country realities adequately. The purpose of this paper is to conceptualizes a framework for energy strategy optimization of the Indian energy sector, which can be applied in all emerging economies. Design/methodology/approach: Hierarchical multi-objective policy optimization methodology adopts a policy-centric approach and groups the energy strategies into multi-level portfolios based on convergence of objectives appropriate to each level. This arrangement facilitates application of the optimality principle of dynamic programming. Synchronised optimization of strategies with respect to the common objectives at each level results in optimal policy portfolios. Findings: The reductionist policy-centric approach to complex energy economy modelling, facilitated by the dynamic programming methodology, is most suitable for policy optimization in the context of a developing country. Barriers to project implementation and cost risks are critical features of developing countries which are captured in the framework in the form of a comprehensive risk barrier index. Genetic algorithms are suitable for optimization of the first level objectives, while the efficiency approach, using restricted weight stochastic data envelopment analysis, is appropriate for higher levels of the objective hierarchy. Research limitations/implications: The methodology has been designed for application to the energy sector planning for India's 12th Five Year Plan for which the objectives of faster growth, better inclusion, energy security and sustainability have been identified. The conceptual framework combines, within the policy domain, the bottom-up and top-down processes to form a hybrid modelling approach yielding optimal outcomes, transparent and convincing to the policy makers.

The framework can be employed to capture the evolution of energy security in an energy system by analyzing the results of indicator-specific metrics applied to the energy, demand, and environment flows associated with the system's constituent processes.

Under a range of reasonable assumptions, decoupling can incent a utility to invest in DSM. However, a utility experiencing high natural load growth and little inflation is likely to resist the imposition of a decoupling mechanism, as it would tend to lower profits. A utility with low growth in per-customer sales will tend to favor decoupling, as it will tend to lead to higher profits than under traditional regulation. The results presented here are quite sensitive to the assumptions made regarding natural load growth, regulatory lag, the frequency of price changes, price elasticity of demand, and other factors.

This paper provides the first quantitative estimate of the possible reduction in losses, for a situation where domestic energy demand is shifted in time but not reduced. At a likely 0.02% of energy distributed by the network, the reduction is small relative to overall losses and to their variability, giving little rationale for distribution network operators in Great Britain to encourage such load-shifting for that reason. The paper also considers the limited regulatory incentives for the reduction, and the fragmentation of costs and benefits across different parties. The societal value is considerably higher than the current regulatory incentive, but nonetheless may still not warrant the cost of action. Reducing rather than shifting load is likely to give greater environmental benefits. \u00a9 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.", "2009"]

Consideration is given to the sizing and utilization of an electrolyser stock for three electrolyser implementation cases and three operational strategies, installed capacity ranges of 20-100% for wind power and 10-35% for zero-carbon thermal power plant (as proportions of the power system's maximum electrical demand) were investigated. Relative to wind-hydrogen alone, hydrogen yields are substantially increased especially on low-wind days. The average load placed on fossil-fuelled power plant is substantially decreased (while achieving a virtually flat load profile) and the carbon intensity of electricity can be reduced to values of <0.1 kg CO2/kWhe. The trade-offs between the carbon intensity of the electricity delivered, the carbon intensity of the hydrogen produced and the daily hydrogen yield are explored. For example (on the variable wind day for Strategy C with respective wind power and zero-carbon thermal power penetrations of 100% and 35%), if the carbon intensity of hydrogen is relaxed from 0 to 3 kg CO2/kg H2, the hydrogen yield can be increased from 435 tonnes to 1115 tonnes (which is the energy equivalent of 120% of consumer demand for electricity on that day). The findings suggest that the deployment of electrolysers on both the supply and demand-side of the power system can contribute nationally-significant amounts of zero or low-carbon hydrogen without exceeding the power system's current maximum system demand. \u00a9 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Consequently, also the embodiment of balancing power markets drives mainly the effectiveness of political implications for the energy sector. Initially, tertiary control in Germany was solely offered by transmission system operators of the respective power control areas and their associated power plant. The recast of the Energy Industry Act of 2005 led in last consequence to a common procurement auction for the supply of tertiary control, which starts on December 1, 2006. Admittedly, the reform has fallen short of expectations so far, first concerning the intensification of market entry of tertiary control providers as well as the desired decline of the price level. Hence, this article examines the effects of the changeover on observable demand charges. In order to identify attributes of the common procurement auction for tertiary control hampering market entry of providers, giving stimuli to collusion and strategic behavior, reducing intensity of competition and encouraging an upswing of prices, we analyze the design under an auction theoretical approach and deduce empirically whether structural components of the auction design have to be touched up again. \u00a9 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Indeed since human electricity consumption is frequently small at night and larger when the sun is shining, there is already a natural correlation. Existing power systems are currently geared to provide this variable demand, with baseload plants cheaply providing a constant level of power, and dispatchable plants dynamically (and more expensively) supplying the rest. This leads to the frequent suggestion that one can exploit the correlation between sunlight and electricity by using energy from solar panels during the day to offset some of the load previously generated by dispatchable plants. This paper addresses the question of how much of the load can be substituted by the solar electricity, without leaving the solar power plant substantially idle or requiring the solar power to be stored. It uses historical sunlight and electrical load data from 32 regions of the United States to determine the photovoltaic (PV) power generation capacity that could be installed such that \"almost all\" of its energy output would occur at times of high demand. Specifically, what is the maximum deployment that permits 95% of the annual output from PV to be utilized without reducing the output of the baseload plants? Our results for these 32 regions are that 7.8% of the total annual electricity demand could be met by installing 59 GW of PV panels. This represents about a fourth of the present electrical energy supplied by dispatchable plants. If solar power were equally effective in the rest of the United States, nearly 200 GW of PV capacity could be put to use without any energy storage. Thus, in the near term, there is enormous room for expanding the roughly 1 GW installed base of PV power without investing in night-time energy storage. The paper also provides insight into how year-to-year variability of sunlight and demand impact the results. \u00a9 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.", "2009"]

Domestic and industrial electricity users had to suffer from black outs all over the country. It is argued that partially the reason was the lack of research on energy, locally. However, Eskom argues that the lack of capacity can only be solved by building new power plants. The objective of this study is to specify the variables that explain the electricity demand in South Africa and to forecast electricity demand by creating a model using the Engle-Granger methodology for co-integration and Error Correction models. By producing reliable results, this study will make a significant contribution that will improve the status quo of energy research in South Africa.

This paper presents a literature review concerning the effects of DST on energy use. Simple estimates suggest a reduction in national electricity use of around 0.5%, as a result of residential lighting reduction. Several studies have demonstrated effects of this size based on more complex simulations or on measured data. However, there are just as many studies that suggest no effect, and some studies suggest overall energy penalties, particularly if gasoline consumption is accounted for. There is general consensus that DST does contribute to an evening reduction in peak demand for electricity, though this may be offset by an increase in the morning. Nevertheless, the basic patterns of energy use, and the energy efficiency of buildings and equipment have changed since many of these studies were conducted. Therefore, we recommend that future energy policy decisions regarding changes to DST be preceded by high-quality research based on detailed analysis of prevailing energy use, and behaviours and systems that affect energy use.

Solutions to intermittency include the use of rapid-response backup generation and chemical or mechanical storage of electricity. Meanwhile, in many jurisdictions with lengthy heating seasons, finding secure and preferably environmentally benign supplies of energy for space heating is also becoming a significant challenge because of volatile energy markets. Most, if not all, electricity suppliers treat these twin challenges as separate issues: supply (integrating intermittent renewables) and demand (electric space heating). However, if space heating demand can be met from an intermittent supply of electricity, then both of these issues can be addressed simultaneously. One such approach is to use off-the-shelf electric thermal storage systems. This paper examines the potential of this approach by applying the output from a 5.15\u00a0MW wind farm to the residential heating demands of detached households in the Canadian province of Prince Edward Island. The paper shows that for the heating season considered, up to 500 households could have over 95 percent of their space heating demand met from the wind farm in question.

However, such systems are strongly questioned due to extreme life-cycle (LC) energy requirements. For similar installations to be considered as environmentally sustainable, their LC energy content must be compensated by the respective useful energy production, i.e. their energy pay-back period (EPBP) should be found less than their service period. In this context, an optimum sizing methodology is currently developed, based on the criterion of minimum embodied energy. Various energy autonomous stand-alone PV-lead-acid battery systems are examined and two different cases are investigated; a high solar potential area and a medium solar potential area.

The article then suggests a tariff system aimed at encouraging customers with an air conditioning load to cooperate with the electric utilities toward saving energy, achieving diversity between the original load and the air conditioning component, applying cooling energy storage systems, and efficiently controlling the starting time and duration. A system of inverted energy blocks and an exponential penalty function are recommended in order to encourage the customer to operate the air conditioning during daily time intervals far from the customer's original peak. Both the combined maximum demand and the demand charge increase almost linearly with the p.u. energy consumption of the air conditioning load. If the cooling energy is taken over durations longer than 20 hr/day, the demand charge will be reduced to about 80%, based on the case in which the original and the air conditioning load are coincident. The more than proportional increase in the energy bill will encourage the customer to adopt some measures in order to save cooling energy. For a certain required air conditioning energy, the total monthly bill depends strongly on its staring time. The advantage of starting the air conditioning load before 0700 or after 2000 could be seen. With the shifting of the air conditioning load, the customer will realize that a monthly savings of up to approximately 17% can be achieved. The total monthly bill can fluctuate between a value in excess of $220,000 and approximately $150,000/month, depending on the way the air conditioning is operated. It could be found that there is a duration for which the total bill reaches a minimum with an optimal duration of 11.9 hr. The customer has to adjust the operation scenario of air conditioning such that the entire cooling load will take place during the off-peak period of the system's load curve. This will encourage the user to consider and check the feasibility of using cooling energy storage systems that can enable such shifting of the air conditioning load.

Finally, the loss of load expectation and cost of energy not served have the least effect on the overall system expansion cost. These results highlight the importance to be placed on performing sensitivity analyses to determine the most cost effective and acceptable expansion plan of the electric power system. There is a need to continually update the planning criteria to cater for changes and developments in the power system and the economic situation.

It is concluded that the linearity is rejected in 4 cases in 7 Turkish sectors. In addition, when LM (Lagrange multiplier) tests that account for at most two structural breaks are taken into account for residential, industrial and agricultural where energy consumption follow a linear behavior, the unit root null is rejected. This means that energy demand management policies designed to shrink energy consumption will instead have a transitory impact on the energy consumption and return it toward its original trend path. On the other hand, it's concluded that the transportation, non-energy uses & other, final energy consumption and cycle & energy sector's energy consumption are non-stationary which means that any shock to energy consumption is likely to be permanent and energy demand management policies will have a permanent impact on these sectors. \u00a9 2011.", "2011"]

The paper builds upon several comprehensive databases designed during the work and considerable efforts have been made to review what must be considered the most reliable data. Global oil resources have been investigated on three levels; country, company and field levels. Although no decisive conclusions or quantitative assessments can be made with respect to the global oil resource base, remaining resources appear to be sufficient to meet demand up to 2030 as projected in the 2006 (and 2007) world energy outlook by the IEA. Significant resources have already been discovered beyond proven reserves, many prospective regions remain to be fully explored and there are vast volumes of recoverable unconventional oil. However, it is also concluded that global supply of oil probably will continue to be tight, both in the medium term as well as in the long term mainly as a consequence of above-ground factors such as investment constraints, geopolitical tensions, limited access to reserves and mature super-giant fields. Production of unconventional oil and synthetic fuels is not believed to significantly alter this situation. Although an increasing number of recent reports have indicated an imminent or \"soon to come\" peak in global oil supply, it has not been found that any of these reports have contributed with any new information on oil resources or oil supply ability. Nevertheless, there is a distinct possibility that global oil production may peak or plateau in a relatively near future, not caused by limited resources but because too many factors over long time constrain investments into exploration and production. The lack of transparency within the oil industry obviously prevents any accurate analysis of future production and supply ability. Moreover, our ability to analyse the sector will become more difficult in the future as oil increasingly will have to be sourced from countries with a poor transparency. The world will become increasingly dependent on a few countries in the Middle East and on Russia not only for the supply of oil but also for the supply of gas which to a large extent will be utilised for power and heat generation. A responsible policy should under these circumstances seek to enhance energy security which should be directed towards promoting energy efficiency measures (reduce demand) in combination with increased utilisation of indigenous fuel resources such as renewables and fossil fuels in combination with CO2 capture and storage. Such a policy would both facilitate the transmission to a more sustainable energy system in the future as well as enhance energy security. \u00a9 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.", "2009"]

Design/methodology/approach - A multi-sector computable general equilibrium (CGE) model of Thailand has been developed to accomplish the objectives of this study. The potential DSM program considered refers to replacement of less efficient electrical appliances with their efficient counterparts in the household sector in Thailand. Findings - The study finds that the economy-wide impacts of the DSM program (e.g., economic welfare, GDP, international trade) depend on three key factors: the project economics of the DSM option or the ratio of unit cost of electricity savings to price of electricity (CPR); the implementation strategy of the DSM option; and scale or size of the DSM option. This paper shows that the welfare impacts of the DSM programs would improve along with the project economics of the DSM programs. If the DSM program is implemented under the CDM, the welfare impacts would increase along with the price for certified emission reductions units. On the other hand, the welfare impacts would increase up to the optimal size or scale of the program, but would start to deteriorate if the size is increased further. Research limitations/implications - The welfare function considered in this paper does not account for benefits of local air pollution reductions.

The ED is calculated as net imports divided by the sum of gross inland energy consumption plus bunkers. This study aims at obtaining numerical equations to estimate of Turkey's energy dependency based on basic energy indicators and sectoral energy consumption by using artificial neural network (ANN) technique. It seeks to contribute to the strategies necessary to preserve the supply-demand balance of Turkey. For this purpose, two different models were used to train the ANN approach. In Model 1, main energy indicators such as total production of primary energy per capita, total gross electricity generation per capita and final energy consumption per capita were used in the input layer of the ANN while sectoral energy consumption per capita was used in Model 2. The ED was in the output layer for both models. Different models were employed to estimate the ED with a high confidence for future projections. The R2 values of ED were found to be 0.999 for both models. In accordance with the analysis results, ED is expected to increase from 72% to 82% within 14 years of period.

In this paper, we present an autonomous and distributed demand-side energy management system among users that takes advantage of a two-way digital communication infrastructure which is envisioned in the future smart grid. We use game theory and formulate an energy consumption scheduling game, where the players are the users and their strategies are the daily schedules of their household appliances and loads. It is assumed that the utility company can adopt adequate pricing tariffs that differentiate the energy usage in time and level. We show that for a common scenario, with a single utility company serving multiple customers, the global optimal performance in terms of minimizing the energy costs is achieved at the Nash equilibrium of the formulated energy consumption scheduling game. The proposed distributed demand-side energy management strategy requires each user to simply apply its best response strategy to the current total load and tariffs in the power distribution system. The users can maintain privacy and do not need to reveal the details on their energy consumption schedules to other users. We also show that users will have the incentives to participate in the energy consumption scheduling game and subscribing to such services.

We use an extended learning curve specification, named multiple factors learning curve (MFLC). In a first stage, we estimate a single MFLC. In a second stage, we estimate the MFLC under the framework of simultaneous system of equations which takes into account the uranium supply and demand. This permits not only to enhance the reliability of the estimation by incorporating the uranium price formation mechanisms in the MFLC via the price variable, but also to give preliminary insights about uranium supply and demand behaviors and the associated effects on the nuclear expansion.Results point out that the nuclear cost has important prospects for decrease via capacity expansion, i.e. learning-by-doing effects. In contrast, they show that the learning-by-searching as well as the scale effects have a limited effect on the cost decrease prospects. Conversely, results also show that uranium price exerts a positive and significant effect on nuclear cost, implying that when the uranium price increases, the nuclear power generation cost decreases. Since uranium is characterized by important physical availability, and since it represents only a minor part in the total nuclear cost, we consider that in a context of increasing demand for nuclear energy the latter result can be explained by the fact that the positive learning effects on the cost of nuclear act in a way to dissipate the negative ones that an increase in uranium price may exert. Further, results give evidence of important inertia in the supply and demand sides as well as evidence of slow correlation between the uranium market and oil market which may limit the inter-fuels substituability effects, that is, nuclear capacity expansion and associated learning-by-doing benefits. \u00a9 2011 Elsevier B.V.", "2011"]

The technique applied is multiple regression and secondary data is used for the purpose of analysis. The study concludes that demand for electricity in the state is price inelastic but income elastic for majority of consuming sectors. An important policy implication thereof is that price hike will be ineffective in regulating and managing demand unless price is varied in an hourly basis. Therefore, the state has to resort to other demand-side management (DSM) measures, such as improving efficiency of electricity use and its conservation.

IHDs provide consumers with direct feedback-real-time information on energy consumption and costs-and turn a once opaque and static electric bill into a transparent, dynamic, and controllable process. However, to what extent do consumers actually respond to the direct feedback provided by IHDs? In this paper, we seek to empirically answer this question by reviewing a dozen utility pilot programs in North America and abroad that focus on the energy conservation impact of IHDs. We also review overall customer opinions and attitudes towards IHDs and direct feedback to the extent that this information is available from the pilot studies. Our review indicates that the direct feedback provided by IHDs encourages consumers to make more efficient use of energy. We find that consumers who actively use an IHD can reduce their consumption of electricity on average by about 7 percent when prepayment of electricity is not involved. When consumers both use an IHD and are on an electricity prepayment system, they can reduce their electricity consumption by about twice that amount. In regard to demand response impacts, we find that the impact of time-of-use rates is augmented by direct feedback from IHDs. \u00a9 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.", "2010"]

An optimisation approach is applied to find an optimal distribution of PV systems on different array orientations and a best-case evaluation of DSM and a storage model are implemented. At high penetration levels, storage is the most efficient option for maximising the solar fraction, but at lower overproduction levels, the impact of DSM is equal or slightly better. An east-west orientation of PV arrays is suggested for high penetration levels, but the effect of the optimised orientation is small. Without an optimised storage operation, the overproduced power is more efficiently reduced by DSM than storage, although this is highly dependent on the applied DSM algorithm.

In a reference scenario, global energy demand for heating is projected to increase until 2030 and then stabilize. In contrast, energy demand for air conditioning is projected to increase rapidly over the whole 2000-2100 period, mostly driven by income growth. The associated CO2 emissions for both heating and cooling increase from 0.8 Gt C in 2000 to 2.2 Gt C in 2100, i.e. about 12% of total CO2 emissions from energy use (the strongest increase occurs in Asia). The net effect of climate change on global energy use and emissions is relatively small as decreases in heating are compensated for by increases in cooling. However, impacts on heating and cooling individually are considerable in this scenario, with heating energy demand decreased by 34% worldwide by 2100 as a result of climate change, and air-conditioning energy demand increased by 72%. At the regional scale considerable impacts can be seen, particularly in South Asia, where energy demand for residential air conditioning could increase by around 50% due to climate change, compared with the situation without climate change. \u00a9 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The information created by load research are the bases for all studies and analyses conducted by the electricity company to plan, monitor, operate, and control the power system. Several attempts were carried out in Jordan to create this very important body of knowledge. Studies and analyses are conducted regularly to update the information. This paper presents the author's experience in conducting load research investigations. These efforts culminated in three distinct contributions, which are still very useful in planning and operation of the power system in Jordan. (1) The first contribution by the author is related to creating a huge database of energy and electricity consumption characteristics, trends, and driving forces. The database is being continuously updated and as such constitutes a very basic tool for all demand forecasting and other planning studies. (2) The second contribution involves the estimation of the cost of un-served (unmet) electrical energy due to outages. This estimate, which is still being used as reference for planning studies carried out in Jordan, was first coined by the author at 1.0US$/kWh. (3) The final contribution concerns the use of the information in the load research database and the accumulated experience in determining peak load composition. This effort created the \"near-exact\" estimate of the characteristics and constitutions of the peak load divided among the various consuming sectors as well as among the various end-uses in Jordan. The results of these contributions are still being used by the electricity sector in Jordan until this day, either as unique information or as a guideline or reference to more recent estimates. More importantly, the efforts, as outlined in the three contributions above, have established a good base and reference point for further ongoing activities to collect, analyze, and use the information by various entities in the electricity sector in Jordan.

To enable these proposals, the CPUC has authorized funding for advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) for two investor-owned LDCs. Assuming regulatory approval of the third LDC's application, the state's US$4.28 billion AMI investment will aid new rate designs for 11.3 million electricity customers. Now that California has AMI, what can the state do with it? With AMI in hand, an LDC can implement service options that can further the state's energy initiatives, ranging from resource adequacy requirement (RAR) to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction. These options can efficiently allocate limited capacity based on each customer's willingness to pay, without the unnecessary distinction between price rationing and reliability differentiation. They can be Pareto superior, welfare dominating the default tariffs that apply to these customers. A case in point is the generalized demand subscription service (GDSS) option proposed in this paper. However, it is unclear whether the option will find wide customer acceptance, without an LDC's intensive customer education and marketing efforts. \u00a9 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

This option value captures the benefit that a LDC enjoys from not serving an end-use load during high-price hours in a wholesale electricity market. It is conservative in that it does not include the cost savings in meeting the LDC's resource adequacy requirement or deferring transmission and distribution (T&D) investments necessary for delivering reliable service.

Further, it details methods using these baselines to make direct comparisons of individual households' energy consumption and evaluate the energy impacts of three prescriptive demand side management (DSM) programs. Design/methodology/approach: To improve estimates of energy savings, the paper proposes using a \"micro\" scale multivariate regression methodology based on a census of utility and property appraiser household data. Findings: Results suggest that traditional analysis approaches are likely to overestimate savings significantly and that the annual community baseline technique provides more consistent estimates of energy savings than most commonly used methods. Practical implications: This type of analysis could provide a tool that utilities can use to more accurately and cost effectively measure DSM savings. This could result in reduced energy demand related to streamlined program setup and management. Originality/value: The proposed methodology is unique in that it defines a new household-level energy consumption baseline measure that we think is a more appropriate performance measure, uses a census of publicly available data for the population of interest, merging metered utility data with property appraiser data, and works upward to construct a simple model for evaluating household-level energy consumption. The critical element that distinguishes our proposed energy performance measures is that they are calculated and interpreted using annual, population-level, comparison-group baselines that effectively normalize for community energy consumption patterns in any given year. \u00a9 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.", "2010"]

This concern was traditionally addressed by the promotion of wind resource studies and acting in the supply side of energy and using energy storage technologies. However, in electric system planning, other options deserve to be evaluated, namely the options related with the energy demand. The most severe problems due to the wind power intermittence happen during the peak load hours. Thus, instead of trying to replace the lost capacity due to the intermittence, other option is to act in the energy demand side, with the aim of reducing the consumption in such hours.

With high prices, subsidies are counterproductive unless consumers fail to make efficiency investments when private benefits exceed costs. If the gain from adopting efficiency is only reduced electricity spending, capping revenues from energy sales may induce a utility to substitute efficiency for generation when the former is less costly.

A great variety of mathematical methods have been used for demand forecasting. The development and improvement of appropriate mathematical tools will lead to more accurate demand forecasting techniques. In order to forecast the monthly electric power demand per hour in Spain for 2 years, this paper presents a comparison between a new forecasting approach considering vector autoregressive (VAR) forecasting models applied to interval time series (ITS) and the iMLP, the multi-layer perceptron model adapted to interval data. In the proposed comparison, for the VAR approach two models are fitted per every hour, one composed of the centre (mid-point) and radius (half-range), and another one of the lower and upper bounds according to the interval representation assumed by the ITS in the learning set. In the case of the iMLP, only the model composed of the centre and radius is fitted. The other interval representation composed of the lower and upper bounds is obtained from the linear combination of the two. This novel approach, obtaining two bivariate models each hour, makes possible to establish, for different periods in the day, which interval representation is more accurate. Furthermore, the comparison between two different techniques adapted to interval time series allows us to determine the efficiency of these models in forecasting electric power demand. It is important to note that the iMLP technique has been selected for the comparison, as it has shown its accuracy in forecasting daily electricity price intervals. This work shows the ITS forecasting methods as a potential tool that will lead to a reduction in risk when making power system planning and operational decisions. \u00a9 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

More specifically, the timing of energy use, particularly electricity, is highly dependent on the timing of the occupants' activities. Thus, in order to model domestic demand profiles with high temporal resolution, for example, in the context of designing and assessing demand side management systems (including the time-shifting of demand), it is of great benefit to take account of residents' behaviour in terms of when they are likely to be using household appliances, lighting and heating. This paper presents a thorough and detailed method for generating realistic occupancy data for UK households, based upon surveyed time-use data describing what people do and when. The approach presented generates statistical occupancy time-series data at a ten-minute resolution and takes account of differences between weekdays and weekends. The model also indicates the number of occupants that are active within a house at a given time, which is important for example in order to model the sharing of energy use (shared use of appliances, etc.) The data from the model can be used as input to any domestic energy model that uses occupancy time-series as a base variable, or any other application that requires detailed occupancy data.

These programs have evolved since the early pilot programs launched in late 1990s. With the changes in market rules the opportunities have generally increased for DR for participating in emergency, economic and ancillary service programs. In recent times, various regulators have suggested that DR can also be used as a solution to meet supply - demand fluctuations in scenarios with significant penetration of variable renewable sources in grid. This paper provides an overview of the evolution of the DR programs in PJM and NYISO markets as well as analyzes current opportunities. Although DR participation has grown, most of the current participation is in the reliability programs, which are designed to provide load curtailment during peak days. This suggests that there is a significant gap between perception of ability of DR to mitigate variability of renewables and reality of current participation. DR in future can be scaled to play a more dynamic role in electricity markets, but that would require changes both on technology as well as policy front.

Two alternative explanations of this phenomenon are: a productivity change that uses less energy and a structural change in the economy in response to rising income. It is not possible to distinguish among these from aggregate data, and economic energy models for forecasting emissions simulate one, as an exogenous time trend, or the other, as energy demand elasticity with respect to income, or both processes for projecting energy demand into the future. In this paper, we ask whether and how it matters which process one uses for projecting energy demand and carbon emissions. We compare two versions of the MIT Emissions Prediction and Policy Analysis (EPPA) model, one using a conventional efficiency time trend approach and the other using an income elasticity approach. We demonstrate that while these two versions yield equivalent projections in the near-term, that they diverge in two important ways: long-run projections and under uncertainty in future productivity growth.

We discuss the policy consequences and argue that the 'energy savings' occurring from the accounting of renewable energy should not distract attention from demand-side energy savings in sectors such as transport, industry and the built environment. The consequence of such a distraction could be that many of the benefits from demand-side energy savings, for example lower energy bills, increase of the renewable energy share in energy consumption without investing in new renewable capacity, and long-term climate targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by more than 80%, will be missed.

On average, over 73% of Brazilian households use these 3-8 kW electrical resistance showerheads. In some of the more temperate climate regions in the south of the country, where most of the Brazilian population is concentrated, electrical showers are present in over 90% of residential buildings. For the residential consumer, while these high-power heating devices are the least-cost investment alternative, they lead to high running energy costs. Furthermore, due to their very low load factor (typically below 2%), each of these high-power showerheads results in considerably low return on the high investment costs in terms of infrastructure for the electricity sector. Particularly in low-income dwellings, electrical showerheads represent by far the highest electrical loads, resulting in a considerable component in the monthly energy bill. On the other hand, Brazil is one of the sunniest countries in the world, and solar water heating technologies have demonstrated large financial benefits and short payback times. Due to their comparatively higher initial investment costs, however, domestic solar water heaters are used mostly in higher income residences. In this work we present the potential of a low-cost version of the typical domestic solar water heating system for low-income dwellings, where the electrical resistance, which is normally installed inside the hot water tank, is replaced by a variable power electrical showerhead. This design avoids the use of electrical power as auxiliary heating for the whole of the boiler volume, since only the water which passes through the showerhead might be heated by the electrical resistance. This system configuration is a commercially available low-cost solar water heater option. A case-study is presented for a statistically representative group of low-income dwellings with solar water heating systems in Florian\u00f3polis - Brazil. Our results show that the economies obtained are considerable, both in terms of energy consumption (kW h) and peak demand (kW) reduction. When compared with higher income typical users of solar water heating technologies, these economies represent a relatively higher benefit, both for the low-income population, as well as for the utilities involved. Our results also show that the avoided power costs, a benefit for the distribution utility company, might be more substantial than the avoided energy costs, a benefit for the end user. In the energy constrained on-peak hours period, the utility company might benefit from being able to sell this energy to other higher paying tariff consumers. \u00a9 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Our analysis of the National Allocation Plans for 27 EU Member States for phase 2 of the EU ETS (2008-2012) suggests that the price and cost effects for improvements in carbon and energy efficiency in the energy and industry sectors will be stronger than in phase 1 (2005-2007), but only because the European Commission has substantially reduced the number of allowances to be allocated by the Member States. To the extent that companies from these sectors (notably power producers) pass through the extra costs for carbon, higher prices for allowances translate into stronger incentives for the demand-side energy efficiency. With the cuts in allocation to energy and industry sectors, these will be forced to greater reductions; thus, the non-ET sectors like household, tertiary, and transport will have to reduce less, which is more in line with the cost-efficient share of emission reductions. The findings also imply that domestic efficiency improvements in the energy and industry sectors may remain limited since companies can make substantial use of credits from the Kyoto Mechanisms. The analysis of the rules for existing installations, new projects, and closures suggests that incentives for energy efficiency are higher in phase 2 than in phase 1 because of the increased application of benchmarking to new and existing installations and because a lower share of allowances will be allocated for free. Nevertheless, there is still ample scope to further improve the EU ETS so that the full potential for energy efficiency can be realized. \u00a9 Springer Science + Business Media B.V. 2008.", "2009"]

With this target predominantly fulfilled with wind generated electricity, the need for increased grid flexibility to facilitate this intermittent energy source is becoming ever more significant.

Another use is electricity arbitrage through the rule of 'buy low, sell high'. This operation tracks the market-clearing price (MCP) profiles and produces profit by exploiting the differences between peak and off-peak prices. The profits made in this way depend on technology characteristics and the market competition level. We investigate the influence of demand-side management (DSM) on ESS profitability when the only income is from provision of electricity arbitrage services, by optimizing the time allocation of the charge and discharge operations. Two scenarios of DSM in the market have been selected for two management periods (MP): 1 day and 3 days. The longer MP is examined in order to investigate the potential for higher economic value when energy transfer to the next day is permitted. The key finding is that a very small load shifting from peaks to off-peaks, due to DSM, significantly affects the ESS profit. The significant profit losses the ESS showed are a result of the high capital costs and the small difference of the peak and off-peak electricity prices in the Greek market. Therefore, under the assumptions we have made for this research, any attempt to use ESS in 'buy low, sell high' operation is not profitable. Copyright \u00a9 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.", "2009"]

The model finds that business as usual models, which involve growth rates in world electricity demand of between 2% and 3.2% p.a., exhibit severe material difficulties before the end of this century. If the growth rate is lowered to 1% p.a., then it may be possible to reach the year 2100 before such difficulties, but it is likely that material constraints will occur early the next century. Steady state scenarios show that silicon based photovoltaic panels could, however, displace fossil fuels before the middle of the century, providing around the same order of magnitude as present (2010) world electricity demand. Scenarios also show that outcomes will be highly dependent upon the rate of improvement of photovoltaic technologies. The analysis does not contend that silicon PV technology is the only technology that will or can be adopted, but as the embodied energy content per kWh generated of this technology is similar to other renewable technologies, such as other solar technologies and wind, it can provide a baseline for examining a transition to a mixture of renewable energy sources. \u00a9 2010 Elsevier Ltd.", "2010"]

An energy hub is an integrated system of units, e.g., a combined heat and power plant and a heat storage, which allows the conversion and storage of multiple energy carriers. In this paper, an extended energy hub model is presented which additionally takes into account the possibility of performing DSM with the load(s) connected to the hub output. Taking into account the energy hub's flexibility to change its output power(s), its economic value is determined with a method based on Monte Carlo simulation. This method calculates an optimal dispatch of the hub for a large amount of possible price paths of the input and output energy carriers. By means of the proposed energy hub Monte Carlo valuation model, integrated systems of multi-energy conversion and storage devices can be valued together with load management schemes.

Population, income per capita, energy intensity and the contribution of electricity to the total energy demand have been taken into account in the calculations. Technological role of different generation technologies, i.e. coal, nuclear, renewable, combined cycle (CC), combined heat and power (CHP) and carbon capture and storage (CCS), are examined in the form of scenarios up to 2050. Nine future scenarios corresponding to three electrical demands and three options for new capacity: minimum cost of electricity, minimum CO2 emissions and a criterion with a compromise between CO2 and cost (CO2-cost criterion) have been proposed. Calculations show reduction in CO2 emissions from 2020 to 2030, reaching a maximum CO2 emission reduction of 90% in 2050 in an efficiency scenario with CCS and renewables.

The major conclusions are the following. First, the competitiveness of microalgal biodiesel decreases as CO2 stabilization constraints become more stringent. The share of microalgal biodiesel and renewable jet fuel produced from it in total global final energy consumption over the time horizon 2010-2100 is 5.1% in the case without CO2 constraints compared with 3.9% and 0.7% in the case of CO2 stabilization at 550ppmv and 400ppmv, respectively. This is because production and combustion of microalgal biodiesel release as much CO2 as is captured from anthropogenic sources and assimilated by microalgae and because CO2 prices raised by stringent CO2 stabilization constraints make the economics of microalgal biodiesel unattractive. Second, the competitiveness of microalgal biodiesel is also greatly affected by microalgal production cost and microalgal lipid yield. Under a 400ppmv CO2 stabilization constraint, a 50% microalgal production cost decrease leads to increase in total global microalgal biodiesel production over the time horizon by a factor of 6.5, while a 50% microalgal lipid yield increase leads to increase in it by a factor of 4.5. Third, microalgal biodiesel plays an important role in satisfying the energy demand in the transport sector, thereby replacing petroleum products and Fischer-Tropsch synfuels. An increasing proportion of microalgal biodiesel is converted into renewable jet fuel over time to be used as a fuel for aircraft. Fourth, either without CO2 constraints or under the 550ppmv CO2 stabilization constraint, the participation of microalgal biodiesel in the global energy market would have a large impact on the global energy supply and consumption structure. This is not only because of its substitution for other forms of final energy, but also because of the need to satisfy the demand for CO2 for microalgal production. \u00a9 2011 Elsevier Ltd.", "2011"]

As part of reform initiatives to enhance long-term sustainability of the country's electricity industry, South Africa's authorities have in recent years sought to develop an electricity pricing framework that is cost reflective and forms the cornerstone of demand management schemes meant to foster changes in consumption behaviour and enhance efficiency in resource use. The effects of any pricing policy on aggregate electricity consumption will depend on a useful understanding of the factors that influence electricity demand, and the magnitude to which electricity demand responds to changes in such factors. In this context, this paper applies the bounds testing approach to cointegration within an autoregressive distributed lag framework to examine the aggregate demand for electricity in South Africa during the period 1960-2007. The results indicate that in the long run, income is the main determinant of electricity demand.

This method has the disadvantage that for hydro and wind electricity production is counted, whereas for thermal electricity the higher input to power plants is counted. Therefore, the Commission looked for an alternative: the final energy method. Also this method has disadvantages. Firstly, electricity consumption is weighed equally to fuel consumption for heat and transport, neglecting higher primary energy demand for electricity. Secondly, non-energy consumption of energy commodities is neglected, artificially raising the percentage renewable energy. Therefore, I introduce a simple substitution method, which measures renewable energy by comparison with hypothetical equivalent conventional energy. Calculations for EU-27 show that the method strongly affects the contributions of different sectors (electricity, heat and transport), sources and countries. Concluding, any credible calculation method should reflect the trade off between conventional and renewable primary energy. A simple substitution method fulfills this condition, contrary to the primary and final energy method.

This regime aims to reduce peak electricity demand (predominantly due to increase in residential air-conditioning usage) and curb greenhouse gas emissions.

This paper discusses the outcomes of a small qualitative study assessing the impact of a DPP trial on household cooling practices in the Australian state of New South Wales.

One approach to overcoming this intermittency is to match it with a load that can be made to follow the wind, such as electric thermal storage systems for space heating. In such configurations, wind-generated electricity can be used for space heating and, if sufficient surplus remains, for recharging the thermal storage system. When there is a demand for heat but no wind available, the thermal storage system can discharge, meeting the space heating requirements. In extreme cases, when the thermal storage system is fully discharged and there is no wind, some form of backup energy source is required. This article examines the technical potential of off-peak electricity to ensure that wind-charged thermal storage systems are able to bridge periods of insufficient wind. The simulations show that wind heating with off-peak backup can reduce surplus electricity generated from the wind and greenhouse gas emissions. The benefits as well as the limitations of the approach are discussed.", "2010"]

A Masdar City case study; Abstract: We propose the introduction of an energy-based parallel currency as a means to ease the transition to energy-conscious living. Abundant fossil energy resources mask the internal and external energy costs for casual energy consumers. This situation is challenging communities that draw a significant fraction of their primary energy consumption from renewable energy sources. The Masdar Energy Credit (MEC) system is a way of translating the fundamental aspects behind energy generation and usage into a tangible reality for all users with built-in fungibility to incentivize collectively sustainable behavior. The energy credit currency (ergo) corresponds with a chosen unit of energy so that the total amount of ergos issued equals the energy supply of the community. Ergos are distributed to users (residents, commercial entities, employees, and visitors) on a subscription basis and can be surrendered in exchange for the energy content of a service. A spot market pricing mechanism is introduced to relate ergos to \"fiat\" currency using a continuously variable exchange rate to prevent depletion of the sustainable energy resource. The MEC system is intended to: (i) meet the sustainable energy balance targets of a community (ii) support peak shaving or load shifting goals, and (iii) raise energy awareness. \u00a9 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The cause for this shortage is thought to be the current Chinese energy pricing system, which is mainly government rather than market controlled. Government-regulated price-caps for coal have seriously affected coal supply. At the same time price-caps for electricity supply have caused suspension of power plant operation. As a result, the average operating time of coal-fired power plants declined 50 h annually across the nation in the first half of 2008 compared to the previous year, despite clear power shortages. Here, it will be suggested that energy pricing, set by supply and demand may effectively discourage excessive growth in heavy industry, substantially encourage energy conservation and efficiency, and curb the rapid electricity demand in China. It will be argued that a market-oriented electricity pricing mechanism is required for China to secure its future power supply. \u00a9 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.", "2009"]

An analysis of the characteristics of the wind power resource of the United Kingdom has been carried out, based on modelling of hourly observed wind speed data from 66 onshore weather recording sites for the period 1970-2003. Patterns of wind power availability are presented, with the data demonstrating that the output from large-scale wind power development in the UK has distinct patterns of monthly and hourly variability. The extent and frequency of high and low wind power events is assessed, and wind power data are matched with electricity demand data to examine the relationship between wind power output and electricity demand. It is demonstrated that wind power output in the UK has a weak, positive correlation to current electricity demand patterns; during peak demand periods, the capacity factor of wind power in the UK is around 30% higher than the annual average capacity factor.

Normally, in contingencies, the difference between the power absorbed and the power produced is very low, often less than 1% of the latter. Therefore if all the loads participated in the load shedding program, the discomfort would be minimal, considering its usually short duration. According to this point of view, we present a new approach to the load shedding program to guarantee the correct electrical system operation by increasing the number of participants. This new load control strategy is named Distributed Interruptible Load Shedding (DILS). Indeed, it is possible to split every user's load into interruptible and uninterruptible parts, and to operate on the interruptible part only. The optimal load reduction request is found by minimizing the expected value of an appropriate cost function, thus taking the uncertainty about the power absorbed by each customer into account. Presently, several users such as hospitals, data centres, supermarkets, universities, industries, etc. might be very interested in typical shedding programs as a way to spare money in their electrical account. However, in the future, when the domotic power plants are likely to be used widely, the distributors could interest the end users in participating in DILS programs for either economic or social reasons. By adopting the DILS program, the distributors can resort to the interruptible loads not only in case of emergency conditions but also during normal and alert operations. \u00a9 2007 IEEE.", "2007"]

The analysis was conducted using the IAEA's model MAED, which relies upon the end-use approach. This model has been validated during the last two decades through the successful application in many developing countries, even those having partial market economy and energy subsidy. Starting from the base year, final energy consumption distributed by energy forms and consumption sectors, the future energy and electricity demand has been projected according to three different scenarios reflecting the possible future demographic, socio-economic and technological development of the country. These scenarios are constructed to cover a plausible range, in which future evolution factors affecting energy demand are expected to lie. The first is a high economy scenario (HS) representing the reference case, which is characterized by high gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate (average annual about 6%) and moderate improved technologies in the various consumption sectors. The second is an energy efficiency scenario (ES), which is identical to HS in all main parameters except these relating to the efficiency improvement and conservation measures. Here, high technology improvement and more effective conservation measures in all consumption sectors are proposed and the role of solar to substitute fossil energy for heating purposes is considered effectively. The third is a low economy scenario (LS) with low GDP growth rate (average annual about 3.5%) and less technology improvement in the consumption sectors. As a consequence, the improvement in the energy efficiency is low and the influence of conservation measures is less effective. Starting from about 10.5 mtoe final energy in the base year, the analysis shows that the projected energy demand will grow annually at average rates of 5%, 4.5% and 3% for the HS, ES and LS, respectively. Comparing to the HS, the conservation measures and technology improvement in the ES would save ca. 0.8 mtoe in 2010, 2.3 mtoe in 2020 and 5.7 mtoe in 2030. The final electricity demand of about 16.7 TWh in the base year will grow annually at average rates of 5.5%, 5% and 3.4% for the HS, ES and LS, respectively.

It also considers the rebound effect (RE) of energy efficiency improvements in the demand side and analyzes the sensitivity of the results to variations in the values of the RE. A framework is developed to decompose the total economy-wide change in the emission of a pollutant into four major components, i.e., structural change-, fuel mix-, final demand- and joint-effects. The final demand effect is further decomposed into three categories, i.e., construction of power plants, electricity final demand and final demand related to electricity using equipments. The factor decomposition framework is then applied in the case of the power sector in Indonesia. A key finding in the case of Indonesia is that in the absence of the RE, there would be total economy-wide reductions in CO2, SO2 and NOx emissions of 431, 1.6 and 1.3 million tons respectively during the planning horizon of 2006-2025 under IRP as compared to that under TEP.

Funding is provided to energy service companies (ESCo's) to implement projects that can achieve load shifting out of this period. This paper describes how an improved in line water heating concept developed in previous studies was implemented into several real life industrial sanitary water heating systems to obtain the DSM load shift required by ESKOM. Measurements from a selection of these plants are provided to illustrate the significant load reductions that are being achieved during 18:00-20:00.

A very good correlation also exists between these measured results and simulations that were done beforehand to predict the DSM potential of the project.

Demand-side management (DSM) is the process of managing the consumption of energy to optimize available and planned generation resources and DSMIPs are the actions conducted by energy suppliers to promote investment in the DSM. In this research, the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method was used to develop a scientific and rational assessment model for DSMIPs. To apply the AHP method, assessment indicators for the assessment have been identified by using the concept of 'plan, do, see' and the decision-making hierarchy was established. Then AHP model was developed to set up the priorities of assessment indicators and a survey of experts from government and energy suppliers was carried out. Finally, the priorities of assessment indicators were calculated based on the result of survey using the AHP method. The assessment model developed from this research will actually be used to assess the results of DSMIPs, which is being carried out by Korea gas corporation (KOGAS) and Korea district heating corporation (KDHC).

It can be applied at the level of neighborhoods, cities and even small regions in order to exploit the synergies between urban design objectives for livable cities and energy management objectives of minimizing energy use and its associated environmental effects for a given standard of living. CEM encompasses (i) land use planning, (ii) transportation management, (iii) site design, and (iv) local energy supply and delivery planning. While traditional energy management focuses on energy using equipment and buildings, CEM also considers the urban land use and infrastructure level. This study applies CEM to four representative communities in British Columbia, Canada, over the period 1995 to 2010, and compares the results to a business-as-usual (BAU) scenario. The aggregate effect is a decrease in energy service costs and energy consumption of 15-30%, and in air emissions (CO2 and NOx) of 30-45%. The methodology and results, with respect to one aspect of CEM - land use planning - are extrapolated to the provincial level in order to estimate total CO2 emission reduction potential. CO2 emissions are reduced by 17% from BAU. Additional approximate calculations (restricted to land use planning) suggest that on a global scale CEM can be an important element in the greenhouse gas emission reduction strategy, especially given the dramatic urban growth anticipated in developing countries in the coming decades. Implementation of CEM requires an array of policy initiatives from governments at all levels, as the following examples illustrate. National and provincial (state) governments can (i) change the legislation governing regional and municipal land use planning, (ii) tie infrastructure grants to CEM type municipal investments, and (iii) provide information support and fiscal incentives for developers. Regional and municipal governments can (i) change zoning objectives, (ii) encourage specific types of developments through development charges and tax incentives to developers, and (iii) work with energy and other utilities to encourage particular energy forms and delivery systems. \u00a9 1997 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

Numerous policy measures including electricity demand-side management (DSM) programs have been adopted in such countries. These measures aim at reducing the growing need for electricity power that increases the dependency on imported foreign oil and damages the environment. On the other hand, the perception that energy can be obtained at very low cost in oil-rich countries led to less attention being paid to the potential of DSM policies in these countries. This paper discusses such potential using the case of the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Since air conditioning is a major source of electric energy consumption, the relationship between climate conditions and electric energy consumption is considered. An electricity demand model is constructed using time series techniques. The fitted model seems to represent these relationships rather well. Forecasts for electricity consumption using the estimated model indicate that a small reduction in cooling degrees requirement might induce a significant reduction in electric energy demand. Hence, a DSM program is proposed with policy actions to include, among others, measures to reduce cooling degrees requirement. \u00a9 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.", "2005"]

An additional factor, the liberalization of the electricity markets, causes every country to review its own DSM activities. Especially in Europe, where the directive for opening the electricity market has a direct impact on the current DSM frameworks, governments will have to consider a change in this framework. In order to achieve this, much research has been done in the past years on how to change the DSM framework in a way that the requirements of both liberalization and the Kyoto Protocol will be met. In this paper, we review the current DSM activities and ongoing research from the starting point 'who should be responsible for implementing DSM'. We conclude that countries have to make explicit choices on how to arrange their DSM activities for the different customers groups. They have to be aware of the fact that some combinations of DSM activities will lead to counter-productive results and therefore inefficiency. This paper also investigates which of these DSM activities fits best in the open market; a critical review of Integrated Resource Planning (IRP) is used as a starting point. We agree with various proponents of IRP that planning towards minimal societal costs is theoretically appropriate, looking from a societal point of view. We also indicate in this paper that the planning process IRP is partly applicable in the open market.

The life spans of Canadian appliances are compared to the underlying assumptions regarding appliance lifetimes used in models of residential energy demand. We find that Canadian appliance retirement patterns differ from those assumed in the previous literature. Socioeconomic factors related to appliance replacement are also examined.

This paper gives new insights into classical real-time pricing (RTP) by considering the case in which demand changes very steeply. We generalize the concept of the ramping costs, and derive an extended form of RTP that achieves the optimal rate of change in quantity demanded by explicitly taking the ramping costs into account. Under the optimal pricing policy, the prices are dramatically reduced during the period corresponding to the lower end of the slope of the load curve. In contrast, the prices are dramatically raised during the period corresponding to the upper end of the slope of the load curve.

Important local considerations for the establishment of a viable program are discussed and the likely impacts of various scenarios are estimated. The two largest conservation opportunities which can be identified in the current South African situation are: (i) better envelope insulation and (ii) improved insulation for the hot water reticulation system. Three future scenarios are investigated in detail. They are: (A) promotion and awareness campaign only, (B) promotion and an interest-free loan as incentive and (C) promotion, loan and enforced minimum standard for new housing. The savings impact and cost of these scenarios are estimated. Scenario C, which includes a minimum standard which is enforced by law, is the most effective. It is predicted to yield an energy saving of around 1000 GWh/year and a peak load reduction of 550 MW by the year 2010. \u00a9 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.", "1999"]

Typically, the AEEI rate is set to 0.5-1.5% improvement per annum. Here, we study historic aggregate energy intensity trends for the US from 1954 to 1994. We show that the historic trends are inconsistent with an autonomous model of improved energy efficiency-especially when the model is used to inform policies that impact energy prices. As an alternative we propose a model of price-induced efficiency, \u03c0, in which aggregate energy intensity trends respond to changes in energy prices beyond price elasticity of demand \u03b5. Our exercise reveals that the aggregate price elasticity of energy demand of the US economy has declined by roughly 15% over the past four decades. But beyond this decline, bringing our simulations and historical data into close correspondence requires \u03c0 to change sign before and after 1974. Before 1974, after accounting for price elasticity of demand, the economy was growing less energy efficient. After 1974, after accounting for the price elasticity of demand, the economy was growing more energy efficient. Furthermore, since 1984, the rate of energy efficiency gain has been declining. When projections of long-term energy use are compared, those with a price-induced energy efficiency formulation generate significantly more price sensitive energy use and emissions trajectories. When in the business as usual scenario energy prices are expected to be rising, climate policies involve lower shadow carbon prices with \u03c0 than with AEEI formulations. In scenarios where energy prices are relatively flat, energy intensity rises leading to CO2 emissions far higher than standard business as usual projections utilizing AEEI assumptions. \u00a9 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Energy efficiency in UK competitive energy markets; Abstract: Liberalisation of energy markets may affect the prospects for energy efficiency in a variety of ways. Downward pressure on prices will reduce incentives for efficiency and the end of a supply monopoly makes more difficult mandating demand side management programmes. On the other hand, the removal of price controls could end some regulatory disincentives, and liberalisation enables suppliers to market energy efficiency bundled with energy units. The overall effects of liberalisation for energy efficiency are therefore complex. This paper focuses on the effects of liberalisation on those characteristics of energy markets which underpin long-term energy inefficiency. These barriers to energy efficiency have been shown to arise from fundamental features of traditional utility markets - notably centralisation, commoditisation and the complexity of demand side investment. The extent to which these will be altered in liberalised markets in the UK is considered. It is concluded that some important market imperfections are not addressed by competition in the supply of energy commodities. However, more fundamental changes may in the longer term encourage more differentiation in supply markets, in which there could be higher priority for energy efficiency. The policy measures which might encourage the process are discussed. \u00a9 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.", "1998"]

These programmes improve the efficiency with which customers use electricity and affect the timing of that use (eg to shift it away from high-cost times). Utilities run such programmes for two primary reasons. One is to improve customer service. The second is to acquire resources that, just like power plants, can meet customer energy service needs. DSM programmes often are less expensive and environmentally cleaner than power plants. By 1994, US utility DSM programmes had cut potential summer peak demand by 7% and annual electricity use by 2%. We examine the economics of DSM in the late 1990s, reviewing current estimates of avoided supply costs and the cost of conserved electricity for DSM programmes.

Many researchers argue that pro rata electricity tariff, with built in positive marginal cost of pumping could bring about efficient use of the resource, though some argue that the levels of tariff in which demand becomes elastic to pricing are too high to be viable from political and socio-economic points of view. The paper presents a theoretical model to analyze farmers' response to changes in power tariff and water allocation regimes vis \u00e0 vis energy and groundwater use. It validates the model by analyzing water productivity in groundwater irrigation under different electricity pricing structures and water allocation regimes. Water productivity was estimated using primary data of gross crop inputs, cost of all inputs, and volumetric water inputs. The analysis shows that unit pricing of electricity influences groundwater use efficiency and productivity positively. It also shows that the levels of pricing at which demand for electricity and groundwater becomes elastic to tariff are socio-economically viable. Further, water productivity impacts of pricing would be highest when water is volumetrically allocated with rationing. Therefore, an effective power tariff policy followed by enforcement of volumetric water allocation could address the issue of efficiency, sustainability and equity in groundwater use in India. \u00a9 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

The rebate rate offered is a critical factor to success but a rational rebate scale determination method that would help strike a proper balance between the incentive offered and the effectiveness of the programme is lacking. For the DSM programmes recently launched in Hong Kong, the rebate rates are disproportionate to the cost and performance of the promoted energy-saving measures, resulting in diverse participation rates among the programmes. This paper presents a conceptual framework for formulating the rebate scales for incentive-based DSM programmes for commercial buildings, which would attract participation of building owners and boost electricity saving. The establishment of the scale starts from developing a performance curve that relates the cost effectiveness and the long-term benefits of different energy-saving DSM measures. The rebate scale is set based on the premise that a proportionally higher rebate rate should be offered for the adoption of each additional measure, which would yield a diminished marginal rate of return. Analysis showed that replacing the current rebate scale by the proposed scale would lead to benefits, both to the building owners and the utility companies. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Of these, the capital crisis is the most talked about. But little has been done to address the root causes of this crisis. This paper, through a case study of Maharashtra state (in western India) demonstrates that integrating DSM options and decentralised generation in power planning can afford substantial relief from the capital and environmental crises. An integrated least cost plan (LCP) is developed for Maharashtra for the decade 1991-2001. The results of LCP are compared with those of the conventional plan. This work has derived inspiration and benefited from the DEFENDUS plan developed by Amulya K.N. Reddy and others for Karnataka state. Official energy demand forecasts suffer from numerous problems, such as opaque methodology and socially unacceptable assumptions regarding sectoral growth rates. Hence, a frozen efficiency (FE) demand forecast has been developed by incorporating the desired development focus. This indicates an energy and power demand growth rate of 6.4% per annum. To meet the incremental demand of 5, 278 MW, the FE scenario, in similar fashion to the conventional plan, banks on only centralised supply sources. The capacity addition plan is based on screening curves evolved after detailed costing of relevant supply options. The FE scenario requires a capacity addition of 7, 760 MW, with an annual cost of Rs.71.47 billion. The LCP starts off using the FE demand forecast for the terminal year. On the basis of the integrated screening curves, economical demand side management (DSM) and decentralised supply options are chosen. The remaining demand is met by the centralised supply options. About 40% of incremental demand is met by DSM options, 15% by the decentralised generation options and the rest, i.e., 45%, by traditional centralised sources. The total cost of the LCP is Rs. 47.66 billion/yr. Despite meeting the same level of energy services as the FE scenario, the LCP results in 33% saving in the lifecycle cost.

Results imply that energy consumption and CO2 emission in China's electricity sector will rise rapidly in all scenarios until 2030-triple or quadruple the 2000 level; however, through structural adjustment in China's electricity sector, and through implementing technical mitigation measures, various degrees of abatement can be achieved.

This led to several studies being done on hot water consumption patterns in this sector. Large amounts of sanitary hot water are also consumed in the commercial sector in buildings such as hotels and in large residences such as those found in the mining industry. The daily profiles of sanitary hot water consumption are not related to any technical process but rather to human behavior and varying ambient conditions. The consumption of sanitary hot water, therefore, represents a challenge to the electrical utility because it is an energy demand that remains one of the biggest contributors to the undesirable high morning and afternoon peaks imposed on the national electricity supply grid. It also represents a challenge to sanitary hot water system designers because the amount of hot water as well as the daily profile in which it is consumed impacts significantly on system design. This paper deals with hot water consumption in the commercial and industrial sectors. In the commercial sector, we look at hotels and in the industrial sector at large mining residences. Both of them are served by centralized hot water systems. Measured results from the systems are compared to data obtained from previous publications. A comparison is also made to illustrate the impact that these differences will have on sanitary hot water system design. Simulations are conducted for these systems using a simulation program developed in previous studies. The results clearly show significant differences in the required heating and storage capacity for the new profiles. A twin peak profile obtained from previous studies in the residential sector was used up to now in studies of heating demand and system design in commercial buildings. The results shown here illustrate the sanitary hot water consumption profile differs significantly from the twin peaks profile with a very high morning peak in hot water consumption. This leads to a requirement for bigger heating and storage capacities in commercial buildings like hotels. A summary of the results are provided in the form of minimum design parameters for different hot water consumption profiles. This study emphasizes the importance of understanding the trends of hot water consumption in buildings, especially when demand side management projects are done on these types of systems. \u00a9 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

A target of reducing these emissions to 60% of their existing figure by 2050 has been adopted. The only way in which this fall could be achieved is by significantly reducing primary energy consumption to between 45% and 75% of the present demand; depending on the energy technology mix. This requires the widespread adoption of energy-saving measures across the economy. It is in this area that thermodynamic analysis can make a major contribution to identifying where the improvement potential lies. Energy options are inevitably constrained by thermodynamic limits on individual plant and the sector as a whole. Nevertheless, energy policy advice to Governments, particularly that in the UK, tends to be dominated by views from the humanities and social sciences. Thermodynamic ideas, by contrast, often appear rather esoteric to the non-specialist; this dichotomy is arguably a manifestation of C.P. Snow's 'two cultures' (the apparent divide between the arts and social sciences on the one hand, and engineering and the natural sciences on the other). Other methods for generating policy advice, including that from the discipline of economics, will not provide substitute insights to those of energy and exergy analysis. However, thermodynamic techniques such as these should not be used alone, but as part of a broader interdisciplinary 'toolkit' of sustainability assessment methods.

It allows the customer's electricity use for cooling to be shifted to off peak period, benefiting both the consumer and the utility. Reduction in peak demand and electricity cost depend on electricity tariff rates, operating strategy, cool storage capacity and climatic conditions. In this paper, a methodology is presented to determine the optimal chilled water storage (CWS) capacity and corresponding operating strategy for the air conditioning loads for different electricity tariffs. This model minimizes the total operating cost of the air conditioning plant by a trade-off between the cost involved for providing the storage and accessories and savings achieved under the specified electricity tariff. A case study for a typical office complex shows that a reduction of 38% in peak demand is possible by adopting the optimal CWS strategy under time of use (TOU) tariff. The corresponding saving in the operating cost for the consumer is 5.9%. The results show that under flat tariffs, the prevalent high consumer discount rates make cool storage unviable.

This reduction in demand is helpful to the utility in at least two ways: first, it minimizes the penalty costs of not being able to meet the peak demand and thus it has the potential to reduce costs; second, it also can defer the need for building new power plants and hence it can release, at least for some period of time, the scarce capital (which is especially important for the developing countries) for use in development activities elsewhere. These two benefits have been considered in detail in the paper. An analytical model has been developed to estimate the conservation potential of the DSM programmes. The model is then used to illustrate the benefit derived by deferring the construction of a new power plant. The model has been applied to the Maharashtra State Electricity Board, an electric utility in India, as a case study. Several scenarios have been constructed to account for different levels of the DSM possibilites. A sensitivity analysis has been carried out to tackle some of the uncertainties associated with the assumptions in the analysis. Copyright \u00a9 1995 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd", "1995"]

Changing the load shape as a result of demand side activities could change the peak load, base load and/or energy demand. Those three variables have to be explicitly modeled into the load curve for properly representing the effects of demand side management. The impact of DSM will be manifested as higher or lower reliability levels. This paper presents an efficient technique to model the system load such that the impact of demand side management on the power system can be easily and accurately evaluated. The proposed technique to model the load duration curve will facilitate the representation of DSM impacts on loss-of-load probability, energy not served and energy consumption. This will provide an analytical method to study the impact of DSM on capacity requirements. So far iterative methods have been applied to study these impacts. The proposed analytical method results in a faster solution with higher accuracy.

However, utility DSM efforts vary enormously across the country, concentrated in only a few stales. This concentration is partly a function of regulatory reforms that remove disincentives to utility shareholders for investments in DSM programs. A key component of these reforms is recovery of the net lost revenues caused by utility DSM programs. These lost revenues occur between rate cases when a utility encourages its customers to improve energy efficiency and cut demand. The reduction in sales means that the utility has less revenue to cover its fixed costs. This article describes a new method, statistical recoupling (SR), that addresses this net-lost-revenue problem. Like other decoupling approaches, SR breaks the link between revenues and sales. Unlike other approaches, SR minimizes changes from traditional regulation. In particular, the revenue risks associated with year-to-year changes in weather and the economy remain with the utility under SR. Statistical recoupling uses statistical models that explain retail electricity sales as functions of the number of utility customers, winter and summer weather, the condition of the local economy, electricity price, and perhaps a few other key variables. These models, along with the actual values of the explanatory variables, are used to estimate \u201callowed\u201d electricity sales and revenues in future years. For example, a utility might use quarterly data from 1980 through 1992 to estimate the SR models. The models would then be used to determine allowed revenues for 1993, 1994, and 1995. Five utilities provided data to use in testing this new approach. The empirical results are quite promising. The annual errors are almost all less than%. And the 3-year averages for these utilities are less than 1%. The lack of patterns across these 3 years and five utilities suggests that statistical recoupling is a robust method. \u00a9 1994 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.", "1994"]

This link between sales and earnings encourages utilities to sell more electricity, whether or not such increased sales benefit customers. For the same reason, utilities often find it difficult to conduct even the most cost-effective energy-efficiency programs: these programs reduce sales, and reduced sales cut earnings. Although the theoretical underpinnings of this problem have been carefully explained, little quantitative analysis exists to identify the magnitude of the problem. This paper provides that quantitative analysis for a Rocky Mountain utility. It shows that a utility that runs modest energy-efficiency programs will find its return on equity cut by almost 100 basis points. Sensitivity analyses confirm that this earnings loss will occur under a wide range of sizes and load factors of energy-efficiency programs, retail price levels and structures, and short-run marginal costs. Shareholder losses are greatest for utilities that run ambitious programs and for which the difference between retail electricity price and average fuel cost is high. This erosion of earnings occurs even though utility customers may receive substantial benefits from these energy-efficiency programs because rapid load growth accelerates the need to build new and often expensive generating capacity. \u00a9 1993.", "1993"]

[9.618306159973145, 11.264057159423828, "Title: Energy efficiency from the perspective of developing countries; Abstract: Energy efficiency improvements are particularly important for developing countries. In most developing countries, the costs of reducing energy use by one kWh with more efficient technology are invariably much lower than the costs of increasing energy supply by one kWh through investments in new energy supply equipment. In fact, if the unit cost of energy supply increases is taken as the reference for comparison, then the relative costs of energy-efficient technologies can turn out to be negative. Thus, capital can be saved by investing in energy efficiency compared to investing in energy supply. Energy needs in the South are different from those of the North because of differences in climate (e.g., space heating is not required in most of the South) and because satisfaction of basic human needs and infrastructure building must be given paramount attention in the South. Consequently, the innovations necessary are also different. For example, innovations in the processing of basic materials (e.g., steel, cement, glass, etc.) are needed in developing countries because these materials are needed for infrastructure-building. Yet innovations in the basic materials-processing industries will come only slowly from the industrialized countries because the infrastructure-building era is largely over there and the demand for basic materials is largely saturated. Because such industries are energy-intensive, innovations would result in less energy-intensive, less costly and cleaner technologies with beneficial implications for energy futures in developing countries. Such opportunities for technological leapfrogging should be identified and utilized. The technical and economic potential for energy saving is 20\u201350% in the case of efficiency improvements in existing installations and 50\u201390% in the case of new installations. The potential for further efficiency improvements through continued research and development is large because fundamental physical constraints on efficiency are remote. The pursuit of energy efficiency improvement should be carried out in parallel with improvements in institutions, entrepreneurship management and human resource development. A key policy is to bring more energy-efficient technologies to the market, and to focus market attention on energy efficiency performance. Several successful approaches have been tried. The incentive structures in the markets are fundamental, as illustrated by integrated resource planning and utility demand side management that took off in the US only after the regulations of the power industry were changed to make it possible for utilities to earn profits on demand side energy efficiency investments. There is a need for an integrated view of the concept and role of energy efficiency revealing its structure and interconnections. Energy efficiency should be an integral characteristic of any product or activity. Emphasis on energy efficiency would liberate resources that can then be used for socio-economic development. \u00a9 1994, International Energy Initiative, Inc.. All rights reserved.", "1994"]

Contrary to concerns raised by some industry analysts, our results indicate the NLRA is a feasible approach to the lost-revenue disincentive. Seven of the 10 states we studied report no substantial problems with their approach. We observed several conditions linked to effective NLRA implementation and, for those states reporting problems, conditions linked to implementation difficulties. Finally, observed changes in utility-investment behavior occur afer implementation of DSM rate reforms, which include deployment of NLRA mechanisms.

In response, the authors developed several algorithms to select such a combination. The algorithms are general enough to be used by other utilities in designing their integrated resource plans. This paper presents these algorithms and demonstrates that least cost planning within an equilibrium system provides the basis for identifying the appropriate scope of any individual DSM programme or group of DSM programmes. The algorithms developed by the authors indicate both how much programme participation is descrable and whether an alternative mix of DSM programmes is more or less cost effective than the one being considered.

Frequency stability of modern power systems has been considerably harmed by fast and unpredictable power variations generated by intermittent power generation sources and flexible loads. The main objective of the power system frequency control is to ensure the generation demand balance at all times. In reality, obtaining precise estimates of the imbalance of power in both transmission and distribution systems is challenging, especially when renewable energy penetration is high. Electric vehicles have become a viable tool to reduce the occasional impact of renewable energy sources engaged in frequency regulation mainly because of vehicle-To-grid technologies and the quick output power management of EV batteries. The rapid response of EVs enhances the effectiveness of the LFC system significantly. This research work investigates a deep learning strategy based on a long short-Term memory recurrent neural network to identify active power fluctuations in real-Time. The new approach assesses power fluctuations from a real-Time observed frequency signal precisely and quickly. The observed power fluctuations can be used as a control reference, allowing automatic generation control to maintain better system frequency and ensure optimum generation cost with the use of demand management techniques. To validate the suggested method and compare it with several classical methods, a realistic model of the Indian power system integrated with distributed generation technology is used. The simulation results clearly indicate the importance of power fluctuation identification as well as the benefits of the proposed strategy.

However, the multiple coupling forms of energy, as well as uncertainties from generation sources and loads have brought tremendous challenges to its optimal dispatch. In this paper, a two-stage coordinated scheduling method is proposed for the user-side integrated energy system that considers energy storage multiple services to minimize long-term operation costs. Besides, the proposed scheduling model is based on a two-part time-of-use electricity price mechanism. The first stage of the model determines the daily initial state of charge of energy storage, the demand management coefficient, and the baseline of demand response. The second stage is intra-day rolling scheduling, and the power scheduling of each unit in the system is optimized under the premise that the closer the time period, the higher the prediction accuracy. Energy storage is investigated for four main service options: 1) demand management; 2) demand response; 3) energy arbitrage; 4) providing reserve capacity. At the same time, a linear energy storage degradation cost model is established.

However, the fundamental reason is that the electrical supply and demand ratio may not be balanced. An excess or scarcity of electricity in the production or consumption of energy can disrupt the system and cause serious difficulties such as voltage drops/rises and, in extreme cases, power outages. Energy management systems can efficiently increase the balance between supply and demand while reducing peak load during unscheduled periods. The energy management system can handle distributing or exchanging energy among the many energy resources available and economically supplying loads in a stable, safe, and effective manner under all power grid operating situations. This article examines the energy control system's structure, goals, benefits, and challenges through an in-depth investigation of the various stakeholders and participants involved in this system.

It is believed that the mismatch between energy demand of a building and instantaneous renewable energy generation can be reduced by controlling energy use through the energy flexibility of the respective building. Enhancing the energy flexibility of a zero-emission building can satisfy the demands of the energy network around the building and contribute to the resilience of the energy system. Meanwhile, in an electricity tariff model with a distinction between peak and off-peak periods, enhancing energy flexibility in buildings can reduce the operating costs of electricity consumption, with benefits to the economic performance of the building itself. In this study, a simulated hypothetical zero-emission office building near the coast with a floating photovoltaic system and tidal stream generator system in Hong Kong from previous study were used in a case study to investigate the impact of energy flexibility control with stationary batteries as the source of energy flexibility. Two flexibility control strategies were designed to demonstrate their impact on the economic performance of the system. After incorporating the \u201cPeak Demand Management\u201d (PDM) programme in Hong Kong, variations in the economic performance of the system were demonstrated through simulations. Considering the incentive provided by the PDM programme, the possibility of achieving a neutral economic performance at different percentages of renewable energy generation over a 20-year life cycle without the feed-in tariff was investigated. Furthermore, two possible modifications for business models and the PDM programme are proposed. The simulation results indicate that both suggestions can significantly improve the economic performance of the system. \u00a9 2022 The Author(s)", "2022"]

Many studies have shown that ensemble learning strategies are more accurate and feasible in practice than individual predictive models. However, the common way processing massive data is still traditional, that is, training and testing them as a whole, ignoring data's inter law and pattern difference, which probably hinders the further improvement of forecasting effect. In this study, the characteristics of building data are identified and classified before model construction. Fully considering the diversities of model structure and parameters, an adaptive ensemble learning strategy is proposed for short-term building electrical loads forecasting. The unsupervised K-means clustering and supervised KNN (K-nearest neighbors) classification methods are combined for data clustering. Total eleven different sub-learners are applied for ensemble learning and a variety of intelligent optimization algorithms are used for parameter adjusting. The overall prediction accuracy is derived through a fusion module. Two sets of short-term electrical load data of actual buildings are used for model verification. The results show that the data clustering based ensemble learning strategy has better forecasting accuracy compared to eleven individual models and previous reported predictions.

The motivation of this research study derives from the overwhelming lack of energy efficiency and conservation practices by consumers in Ghana while the existing generation continues to deplete with the increasing population and their growing energy needs. A survey was conducted on existing generation plants to assess their capacities and average power contributed to the national grid over a 6-month period. Energy efficiency and conservation awareness questionnaires was also administered to selected consumers to test their knowledge in energy efficiency and conservation. An energy audit and demand management program was established and implemented for a set of households, which were later audited, after a 3-month period to ascertain improvements in their energy consumption pattern. The study revealed that the implementation of energy efficiency and conservation measures led to a maximal reduction of energy consumed by 5.14% which is highly significant and subsequently led to positive economic and environmental implications. The study also found out that most of the respondents are unaware of energy efficiency and conservation measures; they make abusive use of non-efficient electrical appliances and do not implement any energy efficiency and conservation measures. The study recommended the development of policies and strategies to conduct mass education, to ensure the implementation of energy efficiency and conservation measures, and also to encourage the use of energy-efficient appliances. Successful implementation of the proposed recommendations contribute significantly to meeting the energy challenge in developing countries and subsequently sustain business while alleviating poverty. \u00a9 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.", "2022"]

However, there are many risks and barriers that can slow down the uptake of EPC, such as the complexity of the process or uncertainty of building performance post-retrofit. The International Performance Measurement and Verification Protocol (IPMVP\u00ae), which was originally developed to help increase investment in energy and water efficiency, demand management and renewable energy projects, has the potential to reduce some of the EPC barriers.

The implementation of energy storage system (ESS) has proven successful in tackling these issues. Compared with the single-type battery energy storage (SBES), the hybrid energy storage system (HESS) is composed by energy-type energy storage and power-type energy storage, which can effectively improve the controllability and schedulability of renewable energy generation. The governments of most countries have implemented a two-part time-of-use tariff mechanism for industrial users. In this context, the paper proposes a solution for the reasonable low-cost configuration and operation of HESS in industrial parks. First of all, this paper creatively combines the Variational Mode Decomposition and Wigner\u2013Ville Distribution (VMD-WVD) algorithm to break down the net load of the industrial park system, and installs the super-capacitors and lithium batteries to smooth the high frequency and low frequency components of the original net load. Secondly, this paper establishes a two-stage monthly and day-ahead optimization model, which is solved by the Chaos Particle Swarm Optimization (CPSO) algorithm. The monthly HESS capacity optimization configuration model is to minimize the total installation cost. And the day-ahead scheduling model maximizes the net income of life cycle, which further improves the user's peak-to-valley arbitrage. The results show that, compared with SBES, the installation of HESS can better achieve peak shaving and reduce grid connection fluctuations. Besides, the installation of HESS can greatly reduce the electricity cost and the basic electricity cost of industrial parks, so that it can save industrial users' production costs. \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd", "2021"]

A heating load criterion was elaborated to describe a dependence of the CHP performance on the local climate conditions.

However, the high power demand of electric heating and cooling devices poses a significant challenge to the electricity supply chain when they are deployed on mass. Adding rooftop solar photovoltaic systems does not necessarily eliminate this problem. Cheap and safe thermal storage offers a potentially viable solution allowing electric HVAC & hot water systems to be deployed with minimal impact on the grid. We propose such a multi-function thermal system combining solar photovoltaics, heat pump, and thermal storage for supplying residential heating, cooling and hot water demand. We investigate the effectiveness of this system in terms of electricity demand management and solar utilisation in different geographical locations. The results illustrate that with effective control, such a system can reduce a building's annual grid-electricity demand by about 50% to 80%, and increase its solar self-consumption to around 60%. The temporal load profile is also significantly reduced and flattened, allowing high level of distributed PV penetration without negative impacts on the grid. We show that these benefits can be earned at a reasonable cost to consumers helping them to reap a positive rate of return compared to alternative options for different climatic and regional conditions.

The Government acknowledged the impossibility of universal grid electrification in the desire time frame (2025\u20132030). This study reviews the struggling rural off-grid initiative in South Africa to unpack effective, sustainable rural electrification approaches. It is based on a thorough evaluation of fellow African successful off-grid initiatives and the country's energy transition that gave rise to its exiting energy landscape. It was revealed that the conventional electrification rate of 5 to 10% annual is not sufficient for the country to accomplish universal grid access by 2030. It requires a minimum of 20% electrification rate per annum at an enormous budget increase of over 200%, amounting to an excess of USD 500 million to achieve universal grid access by 2025.

A new energy policy that mandates the supply of 50 kWh/month electricity through renewable energy source is required. The policy should clearly stipulate incentives for local and provincial municipalities partaking in renewable energy initiatives after independently verified demand reduction. Furthermore, the new policy should also allow for innovative entrepreneurs and programmes to collaborate with said municipalities to achieve its mandate.

Exploring the social acceptability of demand management in Germany and Great Britain; Abstract: The rapid uptake of renewable energy sources requires new forms of flexibility in electricity systems, including a more responsive demand-side. The social acceptability, scale and economic value of flexible demand remain subjects of conjecture. In this paper we inform this debate with a multi-methods approach using three instruments: surveys, observations and modelling. This multi-method approach brings out similarities and differences between Germany and Great Britain in relation to demand-side flexibility. Participants in both countries express a high willingness to participate in time variant tariffs, but their implementation may need to be context specific. In Germany national peak demand occurs at midday, when PV generation results in lower emission factors. Conversely, British peak demand is in the early evening when emission factors are at their highest. The differences in responses allow us to explore important technical and cultural differences affecting the need for flexibility. Germany gains most from flexibility during the daytime in summer, while flexibility in Great Britain contributes most during winter evenings. We observe high degrees of acceptability of time-variant electricity tariffs (55%) and willingness to shift demand is high, resulting in peak demand reductions of up to 14.5%. However, the resulting cost and carbon savings of these efforts is less than 2% in both countries.

Results indicate potential savings on reducing electricity costs in the range of 6.8% to 11.0% based on P2P trading features.

Applying activity-based modelling in the context of the United Kingdom; Abstract: Driven by the necessity to increase utilisation of the existing networks and accommodation of volatility in renewable energy generation, the energy sector is undergoing a shift from an unconstrained infrastructure expansion to accommodate growth in demand towards demand management strategies. Such strategies, for example nudging demand using incentives such as price signals, or Demand Side Response (DSR), rely on the ability to accurately understand and harness flexibility in demand. Activity-based demand modelling frameworks can provide this capability, as they enable the detailed modelling and simulation of individuals and their activities. However, to date, no modelling approach has been proposed that can link energy consumption of a household to the activities undertaken, heterogeneity of the household residents, presence and use of household appliances and devices as well as weather and energy system-related variables. This paper addresses the gap by proposing a log-linear mixed-effects model of energy consumption based on reported household activities alongside a comprehensive set of attributes and contextual variables that might influence household energy consumption. Application of the model is demonstrated using joint time-use and residential electricity consumption data from 160 households, collected between 2016 and 2018 in the UK. The modelling results prove the value of incorporating time-use (activities) in modelling residential electricity demand, when compared against modelling without such considerations.

In order to solve the proposed bi-level model efficiently, it is first equivalently converted into a single-level mathematical programming with equilibrium constraints (MPEC), and then reformulated as a mixed-integer second-order conic programming (MISOCP) model by linearizing bilinear terms.

However, overloading beyond the administrative grid connection capacity limit would result in an increased connection capacity, thus prosumers have to pay the increased electricity bill for the rest of the year. Therefore, it is important to optimize the energy generation and consumption profiles of local energy communities (LECs) considering the comfort level of occupants. This work aims to reduce the overloading of the grid connection and increase the utilization of local renewable energy resources (RES) thus avoids being penalized throughout the year due to casual intermittent overloading in peak hours, even once in a year. The present work proposes a novel data-driven flexibility optimizer model for day-ahead scheduling of energy profiles for LECs, considering photovoltaic (PV) generation, heat pump (HPs), and cooling loads. The proposed methodology has been developed to explore the flexibility potentials from a university campus network which includes both electrical and heating/cooling systems in an integrated way. A two-layer optimization strategy is developed, to guard the occupant's comfort level. Simulation has been performed for complete two months, considering winter and summer scenarios. A peak demand reduction of 16% has been observed with negligible energy usage differences between the proposed and the baseline case. Two types of flexibility indicators are estimated to give a deeper insight into the performance. Economical gains of 9 % and 16 % are estimated depending on the type and voltage level of the connection. \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd", "2021"]

Besides, in the context of parcel delivery deep growth related to e-commerce, electric vehicle is becoming an alternative to conventional fossil fuel technology. Intrinsically, the charging process implies the interdependence between the transportation and electric power systems. This paper presents a new multistage optimization-based approach that allows linking delivery routing and aggregated demand management in the transportation and electric power systems, respectively. For the routing and charging of each independent electric vehicle, battery degradation, acceleration- and speed-dependent power consumption, penalty for delivery delay, tolls, fixed charging prices and incentives for availability time are considered. An electric vehicle demand aggregator is used to guarantee the synergy between systems. Incentives are included to motivate electric vehicles to remain at charging intersections. However, attractive incentives can create electric power system congestion due to simultaneous charges on nodes. Thus, an iterative decongestion methodology is developed. The resulting model is divided into three stages: delivery allocation, delivery routing for each independent electric vehicle and optimal energy management by electric vehicle demand aggregator. The resulting optimization problem is cast as a mixed-integer linear programming model for the first two stages and a linear programming model for the third stage. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model on a real 284-intersection map with a set of 100 electric vehicles, showing that incentives allow electric vehicle demand aggregator to achieve cost savings of 8.5%. \u00a9 2021 The Author(s)", "2021"]

With the rapid development and the promising application of energy internet and grid modernization, the accurate load modeling and forecasting especially by load pattern modeling (LPM) have become more and more critical to observe and estimate load profile so as to optimize the operation efficiency of the power grid. Traditional methods mostly focus on the static LPM itself which are unable to account the non-linear and highly dynamic load fluctuations in order to balance the demand of the power grid during various calendar period (VCP) scheduling. In this paper, a load pattern modeling method for power grid considering the impact of typical calendar effects is proposed using a combination of improved variational mode decomposition (IVMD) and deep belief network (DBN) algorithm. Firstly, an index of load curve curvature (LCC) is proposed to improve the selection of value K in the conventional VMD algorithm. The value K of the intrinsic modality is determined by adopting LCC to better quantify the average instantaneous frequency of the modal decomposition of the VMD and to reduce the elevated stochasticity of k. Secondly, an optimization formulation is developed based on adaptive segmented loop decomposition of the typical correlation coefficient to suppress the edge effect in VMD decomposition, which would enable the reconstructed curve to incorporate the variabilities from the initial data. Finally, the IVMD and DBN algorithms are jointly implemented to optimize the accuracy of VCP load pattern modeling curve regression. Numerical examples have been performed with the results proving that the proposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-art in reducing the modeling error of VCP load curve, improving the overall forecasting accuracy, and reducing load dispatching cost. \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd", "2019"]

In this study, a renewable based grid-photovoltaic (PV)-boiler-battery-fuel cell hybrid energy system (RBHES) has been scheduled according to the uncertainty modeling of upstream net price and employment of demand response program (DRP). The main reason of implementing DRP is to motivate electricity consumers to modify their energy usage pattern in a way that economic goals of RBHES are obtained. In this paper, interval optimization technique has been used to model the uncertainty of upstream net price and to prepare a stabilized condition for safe operation of RBHES. Converting the single-objective-uncertainty-based model into a deterministic multi-objective model with average and deviation costs, the interval optimization technique models uncertainty and guarantees the optimal performance of RBHES under the minimum impact of upstream net price uncertainty. To solve the aforementioned multi-objective model, the weighted sum technique and the fuzzy approach are used. An RBHES has been investigated as a case study and the simulation results showing positive effects of employed techniques are presented for comparison. In cases with and without DRP, the average costs of RBHES in the interval method in comparison with the deterministic method have increased 1.61 % and 2.06 %, respectively. This is while the deviation costs of RBHES has reduced up to 13.61 % and 15.28 %, respectively.

This paper presents a domestic heating costs calculation method for different heating technologies (gas boiler, heat-pumps) and a range of energy tariffs. Based on physical modeling, effect of outdoor temperature in the COP of heat-pumps is assessed. The methodology is applied to the 2018/19 heating season in Madrid (Spain), calculating the heating costs under four diverse energy tariffs (static gas tariff, static electricity tariff, real-time-price electricity tariff, dynamic time-of-use electricity tariff) for a typical home demand. The hourly results for two representative days are detailed, along with the aggregated results for the whole season. Along the season, the continuous changes in energy wholesale market prices and weather conditions make one heating technology and/or tariff more convenient each time. For the whole season, the dynamic time-of-use tariff considered would imply heating costs up to 40% lower than the static gas tariff. The results are strongly conditioned by climate conditions and national energy market evolutions. Day-ahead information on the actual heating costs might lead to domestic end-users to adapt their behavior and consumption patterns for more cost-effective use of the energy. \u00a9 2020 The Authors", "2020"]

Above and beyond the mass rollout of smart meters, there are various behavioural considerations that can affect the way in which consumers react to information enabling the adaptation of their consumption behaviour in response to dynamic pricing. Indeed, many empirical studies have been conducted in various countries aimed at determining how consumers respond to feedback on their consumption and prices. However, if users fail to demonstrate a pro-active attitude, they cannot hope to take advantage of the opportunities afforded by new technologies. By reporting a systematic analysis of bibliographic references, this article seeks to further understanding as to why consumers behave as they do when managing their demand, a process that, ultimately, is for the benefit of the electrical system, in particular, and of the whole of society, in general. The policy implications that emerge from our analysis highlight the heterogeneity of consumer engagement in demand management programs, depending on the degree of preference satisfaction achieved by means of personalised contract terms and the degree and persistence of consumer change, which are dependent on the cost, frequency and quality of information. \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd", "2020"]

However, previous work has not comprehensively modelled the inconvenience experienced by end-consumers due to demand modifications, since it has focused on static modelling approaches. This paper presents a novel model of inconvenience cost that simultaneously accounts for differentiated preferences of consumer groups, time and duration of interruptions, differentiated valuation of different units of power and temporal redistribution of shiftable loads. This model is dynamic and future-agnostic, implying that it captures the time-coupling characteristics of consumers\u2019 flexibility and the temporal evolution of interruptions, without resorting to the unrealistic assumption that time and duration of interruptions are foreknown. The model is quantitatively informed by publicly available surveys combined with realistic assumptions and suitable sensitivity analyses regarding aspects excluded from existing surveys.

To answer these questions, this study offers a comprehensive and global research synthesis of externalities for energy and mobility. It synthesizes data from 139 studies with 704 distinct estimates to examine the hidden social and environmental costs. The mean external cost for electricity supply is 7.15\u00a2/kWh. When correlating this with the actual amount of electricity generated per year, the amount is $11.644 trillion. This likely exceeds both the reported revenues for electricity sales, oil and gas production as well as the levelized costs of energy. The mean external cost for mobility is 17.8\u00a2/km.

Load clustering is a key topic of load management. However, at most of the time load distribution is complex and is highly related to wide socioeconomic and demographic factors. This makes load clustering a hard problem especially when only aggregate load data is available. This paper proposes a method that firstly encodes an arbitrary load into an embedding centroid vector, and secondly carries out clustering based on the embeddings. An unsupervised pretraining approach is proposed as an embedding system. In this framework, only aggregate load data is needed. This paper put forward a metric to identify the accuracy of the embedding system. Under this metric, the proposed method is superior to a na\u00efve auto-encoding approach which is a successful unsupervised pretraining method in data compression and reconstruction. When an outer dataset is applied, the proposed method can still get higher scores, which indicates good generalization ability of the method.

Unfortunately, the hourly based energy load profiles are not directly available with the energy suppliers due to cost constraints.

This model optimizes the investment decisions of all the infrastructures as well as the corresponding operational strategies in a coordinated manner. Therefore, the final solution is identified by the optimal type, location and size of the feeders, distributed generators, capacitor banks, static var compensators, voltage regulators, energy storage systems, and transformer substations. To incorporate the optimal load reduction into active network management, the optimal load-shedding direction is first introduced, and an iterative method is developed to compute it.

With the intermittent output of RESs due to the uncertainty in solar irradiation and wind speed, the forecasting unit will inform the operator on the power production levels in the upcoming 24 h.

Additionally, in smart polygeneration grids, thermal energy storage devices are essential to achieve high flexibility in energy demand management at relatively low cost. In this scenario, accurate evaluation of state of charge of storage vessels based on available measurements is critical. The aim of this paper is to develop and compare three different models for state of charge estimation in stratified water tanks (discrete temperature measurements) and the related application in an experimental polygeneration grid with a real-time management tool. The first model is based on the empirical calculation of the state of charge considering the thermal power difference between generation and consumption, and afterwards correction based on measured temperatures. The second model is a mathematical approach considering a pre-defined temperature shape fitted with experimental data. The latter model is based on a 1-D physical approach using a multi-nodal method forced on the basis of the measured temperatures. The models were compared considering an experimental test performed in the polygeneration laboratory by the Thermochemical Power Group (TPG). As a result of the comparative analysis, the first model was selected for applications in complex polygeneration grids, due to its good compromise between accuracy and computational effort. Several tests were carried out to demonstrate the performance of the empirical approach selected for the thermal storage model and the economic benefit related to the utilization of this vessel. The experimental plant, constituted by two different prime movers (a 100 kW microturbine and a 20 kW internal combustion engine) and a thermal storage tank, was able to demonstrate the performance of a real-time management tool. For this reason, special attention was devoted to the variable cost comparisons. The novelty of this work lies in the development of the real-time management tool coupled with a thermal storage model by considering the simplified modelling approach. This is an essential requisite for complex polygeneration grids including hundreds or thousands of prime movers and thermal storage devices. Additionally, it is important to state that in such cases the required real-time performance could be difficult to obtain. The results, produced with the innovative and flexible experimental rig, demonstrate the positive impact of thermal storage as well as the effective management performance of this quite simple dispatching approach.

The following discussions develop these initial findings to explore how interventions might support individual experimentation with alternative shopping, cooking and eating practices, and in so doing influence the ongoing evolution of food-related routines to the benefit of energy demand management. \u00a9 2017 The Authors", "2018"]

As we move towards technology-rich zero-energy homes, the challenge of managing energy use and electricity generation systems will increase and a new role for in-home feedback displays may emerge. This paper describes the in-home display and monitoring systems installed in a near-net zero-energy residential estate and provides a summary of the energy-use data generated by the systems. It also draws on 25 in-depth interviews to discuss the residents\u2019 attitudes towards, and experiences interacting with, the in-home feedback display and energy management system. Residents describe how the feedback displays assist them to understand their end-use energy behaviour, reduce net energy use and assess whether household appliances and renewable energy systems are operating correctly.

Demand forecasting plays a vital role in energy supply-demand management for both governments and private companies. Therefore, using models to accurately forecast the future energy consumption trends\u2014specifically with nonlinear data\u2014is an important issue for the power production and distribution systems. Several techniques have been developed over the last few decades to accurately predict the future in energy consumption. This paper reviews various energy demand-forecasting methods that have been published as research articles between 2005 and 2015. The scope of forecasting applications and techniques is quite large, and this article focuses on the methods which are used to predict energy consumption. The applications of traditional techniques such as econometric and time series models along with soft computing methods such as neural networks, fuzzy logic and other models are reviewed in the current work. The most cited studies applied neural networks to forecast the energy consumption and approved the notable performance of the models, but computation time is much more than many other methods based on its sophisticated structure. Another field of future research includes the development of hybrid methods.

Therefore, the electric demand response management (DRM) system was introduced to prevent unstable electricity supply both domestically and globally. Unlike power generation in power plants, DRM regulates the demand and supply by reducing building energy consumption. Demand management is divided into energy efficiency and demand response. Energy efficiency reduces normal energy consumption by replacing older equipment and materials with high-efficiency models, remodeling the building envelope, and efficient system operation. Demand response reduces the electric consumption of pre-contracted electrical consumers at certain times, especially at peak load times. To determine the energy savings of buildings, the customer baseline load (CBL) is used. However, the CBL cannot evaluate the energy savings due to the energy efficiency improvements because it only assesses savings based on normal energy consumption. Therefore, DRM has a high incentive for buildings with high-energy consumption, while buildings with implemented energy efficiencies have low incentives, even though electricity demand is reduced. In this paper, we present the standard energy consumption to reflect both energy efficiency and demand response which can help stabilize power supply in the nation. \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Ltd", "2018"]

In this article, we provide a review of the developments in both HVAC control and demand management in recent 5\u00a0years, helping readers to understand the new significant trends and achievements in these both areas. Recent findings: We collected and analyzed a number of representative publications and found that the developments of HVAC system control have two significant trends: to improve the robustness of control and to improve the efficiency of system level real-time optimization; while demand management emphasizes the coordinated control in building-group-level other than single-building-level. Summary: The improvement of the robustness of the HVAC systems control can guarantee the control performance under uncertainties; the improvement of the efficiency of the system level real-time optimization can significantly enhance the building energy efficiency, while the coordinated demand management can optimize the aggregated load profile for better serving the actual needs of a grid.

It uses subsampling confidence interval methods that are more informative than simple unit root tests to describe the underlying process of energy consumption. Because subsampling requires fewer assumptions on the nature of the data generating process, inference is less prone to a number of potential misspecification errors. By focusing on the degree of persistence in the process describing a country's energy consumption, the analysis not only provides evidence on the stationarity or nonstationarity of the energy consumption but also gives insight into the likely success of environmentally oriented government intervention. The analysis finds that the 107 countries can be grouped into three persistence classes: those whose energy consumption is explosive (highly populated countries with high growth rates); those with nonstationary energy consumption (developing and highly oil dependent economies); and those whose energy consumption is stationary (developed and energy-rich countries). In nonstationary cases, government intervention can be effective and produce permanent improvements in energy conservation and other environmental concerns. In stationary cases energy conservation and environmentally-oriented demand-management policies can have only temporary effects and thus designed to speed re-adjustment to the longer run underlying trend. \u00a9 2016 Elsevier B.V.", "2016"]

In particular, forced outages or blackouts have enormous consequences on society, one of which is loss of economic surplus. The society relies on having a continuous supply of electrical energy. Some customers may willingly risk this continuous supply and participate in demand management programs for electrical power. If the power system grid is in trouble, electric utilities need to have demand relief. Customers willing to reduce their demand to help the system can receive an incentive fee for helping the utilities. Demand relief can be system wide or location specific. Sometimes it can be more effective to fix the electrical demand vs. supply imbalance from the demand side. The value of demand management contracts is greatly affected by customer location. Inclusion of locational attributes into the contract design procedure increases the effectiveness of the contracts by helping a utility get more value from its demand management programs. Independent System Operators and regulators, among others, can also benefit from effective demand management.

Many studies have been done in the field of tri-generation systems, but the studies have been more focused on centralized energy sources, such as, steam and gas turbines. Thus, required researches to move the sources of tri-generation systems toward renewable energy resources are not perfect enough. Moreover, the type of operation strategy, which is one of the important issues in investigating tri-generation system, is usually depended on assistant resources, such as, local power grid. In this paper, a novel tri-generation system based on wind and solar renewable energy resources and natural gas as the system prime movers is evaluated. Furthermore, a different operation strategy is considered to minimize the need to auxiliary sources and so the ability to use the system in remote regions, independently. Hence, wind turbines, photovoltaic (PV) modules, and solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) are considered as prime movers of the system. Moreover, a battery bank and heat storage tanks (HSTs) are deployed to balance the fluctuations in produced energy by wind and solar renewable resources. Hence, thermal demand management (TDM) and electrical demand management (EDM) operation strategies are considered simultaneously and defined as two possible functions to achieve a system with the ability to operate independently. In order to obtain the optimized solutions for each system component, a genetic optimization algorithm is applied to solve a resources allocation problem. The possibility of implementation in distant regions, considerable reduction in fuel consumption and pollution are the advantages of the proposed system. The numerical results demonstrate that the fossil fuels consumption and the pollution, respectively, are reduced up to 154 and 207 times more than common separated production (SP) systems.

Various technologies are reduced in availability to determine their relative importance for achieving low costs. The single most important factor is found to be the integration of large quantities of wind; therefore wind integration is identified as a research priority. In contrast, photovoltaics are found to \u201csaturate\u201d the system at less than 10% of total energy (in the absence of storage or demand management, installation of further photovoltaics does not contribute significant further value). This indicates that policies to promote utility-scale photovoltaics should be considered in partnership with complementary measures (such as demand side participation and storage). Biofuelled gas turbines are found to be important; a complete absence of bioenergy increases costs by AU$20\u201330/MWh, and even having only 0.1\u00a0TWh per year of bioenergy available reduces average costs by AU$3\u20134/MWh. Limits on the non-synchronous penetration (NSP) are found to be relatively expensive, suggesting a significant research priority around finding alternative approaches to providing synchronous services, such as inertia. Geothermal and concentrating solar thermal technologies do not appear essential as long as sufficient wind and peaking bioenergy is available. \u00a9 2016 Elsevier Ltd", "2016"]

To reduce the difference and to avoid an excess output of electricity or heat, a complementary combined cooling, heating and power- organic Rankine cycle system (CCHP-ORC) system with a ground source heat pump is configured. In this study, the CCHP-ORC system, which is operated in thermal demand management (TDM) or electricity demand management mode, is employed to analyze the operational cost (OC), annual total cost (ATC), carbon dioxide emission (CDE), primary energy consumption (PEC) and system efficiency based on a case study of a regional energy system in Sino-Singapore eco-city. Meanwhile, the performance analysis of an improved operational mode is also conducted in this study. Following this mode, the waste heat and electricity imported from grid can be minimized by controlling the operation condition of PGU and ORC with a thermal management controller (TMC-ORC mode). Monthly and annual results in the case study show that the proposed system performed well on OC, CDE and PEC reductions and the ATC are both increased except for the ATC of TMC-ORC mode. However, the total efficiency of TDM is the highest among the three operational modes.

However, determining how to evaluate the collective effect of multiple countermeasures in one policy scheme on household energy related behavior is very challenging; furthermore, the potential interactions between policies due to the timing effect cannot be overlooked. Under these concerns, this study provides a quantitative methodology by developing a DAEDMS (dynamic active energy demand management system) that can evaluate the overall effects of urban planning, soft policies for improving household/individual awareness, technology-improvement/rebate policies, market end-use diffusion control, and social-interaction oriented policies. The timing effect is directly incorporated by allowing the free setting of the execution period for each policy. Building on this demand management system, the quantified policy schemes and the pathways that can reach the target of energy conservation become straightforward, providing helpful support for policy planning. Besides, the variant effectiveness of policy schemes due to different policy timings admonishes the policy makers to realize that the current fragmented regime of policy making between different departments is undesirable for capturing the genuine effect of all of the policies. \u00a9 2015 Elsevier Ltd.", "2015"]

CO2 emission was decomposed into emission coefficient, vehicle fuel intensity, vehicle ownership, population intensity and economic growth. In addition, the decoupling effects among economic growth, transport energy demand and CO2 emission were analyzed to better understand the fuel performance and CO2 mitigation strategies for each country. From our results, we suggest that the rapid growths of economy and vehicle ownership were the most important factors for the increased CO2 emissions, whereas population intensity contributed significantly to emission decrease. Energy conservation performance and CO2 mitigation in each country are strongly correlated with environmental pressure and economic driving force, except for Germany in 1993 and Taiwan during 1992-1996.

The MPC strategy is built based on a proposed model that jointly minimizes the total energy consumption and hence, cost of electricity for the user, and the deviation of the inside temperature from the consumer's preference. We develop an algorithm that assigns temperature set-points (reference temperatures) to price ranges based on the consumer's discomfort tolerance index. We also design a practical parameter prediction model for the mapping between the HVAC load and the inside temperature. The prediction model and the produced temperature set-points are integrated as inputs into the MPC controller, which is then used to generate signal actions for the AC unit. To investigate and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we present a simulation based experimental analysis using real-life pricing data. The experiments reveal that the MPC strategy can lead to significant reductions in overall energy consumption and cost savings for the consumer. Results suggest that by providing an efficient response strategy for the consumers, the proposed MPC strategy can enable the utility providers adopt efficient demand management policies using real-time pricing. \u00a9 2013 Elsevier B.V.", "2013"]

The analysis was undertaken using a modified version of MCDA based on the NAIADE (Novel Approach to Imprecise Assessment and Decision Environments) software and involved a decision output based on a mix of qualitative and quantitative assessment, which offered a ranking of options.

This suggests that absolute reduction and demand management should be prioritised over fuel substitution or renewable energy technologies. MCDA was also compared with ecological footprint (EF) analysis for the same set of scenarios and it was found that both metrics show that Scenario 2 is preferable.

The approach focuses on implementing enhanced operations in government buildings, since they are easier to implement and administer.

A total of eight government buildings with different construction and system characteristics were selected for implementing these enhanced operations.

Design/methodology/approach: A RT balancing market, where the RT price varies inversely with the system frequency, is described. In such a market, producers and consumers can get the RT price, simply by monitoring the frequency deviations themselves. Air conditioning load, the main contributor of summer peaks, is selected for DDC. A physically based model of air conditioner load is taken to simulate the load control. A smart load controller is proposed that changes the thermostat setting with deviations in grid frequency/RT price. Simple examples are simulated to show the load reductions achieved by DDC in a single air conditioner, a group of large number of air conditioners and a RT market consisting of four generation companies and four distribution companies. Findings: The result of simulation on a single air conditioner shows that significant reduction in energy consumption can be achieved during severe frequency dips in a RT market. The results of simulation in an example of a RT market show that such load control not only results in better frequency control but also lowers the RT price of power. Practical implications: The demand control mechanism suggested in this paper can be applied to Indian market setting but its applicability to other markets might be limited due to differing, reliability standards, market rules, and regulatory framework. Originality/value: This paper finds that DDC by distribution companies based on RT price/frequency signal not only results in a significant benefit to these companies and consumers but also helps the system operator in frequency regulation.

One effective way of tackling the energy storage problem is to minimise the need for storage, i.e. to switch from a system based on producing electricity in response to the unpredictable whims of demand to one in which consumption adapts to supply. Demand can be managed indirectly via the sending of price/consumption volume signals.

Under this programme consumers receive signals that offer financial incentives for limiting their volume of consumption at time intervals when system peak demand is forecast.

In the district heating industry, enabling of decentralized energy production is one way to meet requirements from customers. In this paper the technical impact of small-scale local solar collectors and heat pumps on district heating distribution networks is investigated. Customers that in this way can both produce and consume district heating are in this paper called prosumers. The study has mainly been performed through simulations in the computer programme NetSim. The results show that since the supply temperature from prosumers often is lower than the typical supply temperature, contribution from prosumers may result in lower supply temperature and thus increased velocity. The differential pressure decreases when water from the prosumers is mixed with supply water from the rest of the network and increases in the area where the prosumer creates a new pressure cone. Areas that are not reached by water from prosumers are affected differently depending on how the control of the differential pressure is managed. The results also show that prosumers' lower supply temperature may cause migratory temperature fronts that lead to increased fatigue in the pipes. This was further investigated by the local district heating company and the result showed that migratory temperature fronts generally has little impact on the lifetime of the pipes, since corrosion remains to be the limiting factor.

The higher level communication was executed through extensible markup language (XML) and simple object access protocol (SOAP).

While both the tariff and certificate price fluctuate around the difference between the costs of green and black energy, the tariff deviates more from the cost difference than the certificate price. The supplies of both black and green energy under FIT are higher than TGC, obviously as a result of subsidies.

The objective of this paper is to review the capacity of some of them and specifically to test the ability of self-organizing maps (SOMs) to filter, classify, and extract patterns from distributor, commercializer, or customer electrical demand databases. These market participants can achieve an interesting benefit through the knowledge of these patterns, for example, to evaluate the potential for distributed generation, energy efficiency, and demand-side response policies (market analysis). For simplicity, customer classification techniques usually used the historic load curves of each user. The first step in the methodology presented in this paper is anomalous data filtering: holidays, maintenance, and wrong measurements must be removed from the database. Subsequently, two different treatments (frequency and time domain) of demand data were tested to feed SOM maps and evaluate the advantages of each approach. Finally, the ability of SOM to classify new customers in different clusters is also examined. Both steps have been performed through a well-known technique: SOM maps. The results clearly show the suitability of this approach to improve data management and to easily find coherent clusters between electrical users, accounting for relevant information about weekend demand patterns. \u00a9 2006 IEEE.", "2006"]

Western Australia is geographically isolated and the electricity network has no interconnection with neighbouring regions. The State energy and vehicle markets are independent of issues occurring in neighbouring states. Western Australia is a relatively clean sample space. This study eliminates uncertainty in vehicle adoption rates from analysis by assuming that all new vehicles are EVs. This gives a worst case scenario in terms of load growth and shows that it will over 200,000 EVs, which represents 10% of the fleet, before there is any significant impact on peak demand even if charging behaviours are left unfettered. The study also shows, however, that the electricity supply and transmission industry can achieve significant short- and long-term benefits if vehicle charging behaviours are managed from the outset, through, for example, demand management or structured tariffs. In the short-term, providing incentive for off-peak recharging increases utilisation of existing transmission capacity, and cheaper, more efficient base-load generation infrastructure. In the long-term, investment in more underutilised capacity can be avoided. \u00a9 2011 Elsevier Ltd.", "2011"]

Energy efficiency and demand management activities in office buildings may be an alternative to electricity network augmentation, with significant economic and environmental benefits. This paper identifies and characterises trends in electricity peak demand in Sydney's office buildings, comparing a range of high and low energy consuming buildings. The paper assesses the potential for energy efficiency and demand management strategies in office buildings to reduce peak loads and hence defer electricity network augmentation. Base building electricity load data was analysed for a sample of 25 Sydney office buildings, along with Sydney electricity substation and temperature data. Peak loads for buildings with best practice energy performance were found to be 26% lower than for buildings with average energy performance, while annual electricity consumption was 57% lower. With these findings, this paper has assessed the effectiveness of current energy efficiency policy for peak demand management and has recommended strengthening energy efficiency policies in order to capture coincidental peak load reductions, as well as new policies specifically targeting peak demand management. It was found that these measures could offer significant potential to defer network investment. \u00a9 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.", "2011"]

Electricity consumption is modeled as a function of social activities of consumers. The dynamics of these activities are modeled as a Markov chain. Markov models are simplified models that capture the stochasticity to the unmodeled dynamics typically attributed to white noise disturbances. Additional uncertainties are also accrued in the process of calibrating the transition rates of these chains from finite samples. In this paper, these uncertainties are accounted for by considering random transition matrices. Such formalism can also reflect the fluctuations in the environment in which the chain evolves. We also discuss a third interpretation where uncertain transitions, in a multiscale setting, reflect the fine-resolution information that is lost in the process of state aggregation. As numerical demonstration, we study the activity modeling of a heterogeneous population. Activity uncertainties are propagated onto the energy demand. Demand uncertainties, in turn, are propagated onto a global performance metric. Such uncertainty management framework bridges between the actual drivers of the energy consumption and the system health.

Additionally, the same SOFC system is integrated with photovoltaic technology in a 7 home zero carbon community. The community approach adds a significant benefit given it increases the amount of electricity generated by the SOFC system which is used onsite by 128%, being the price of imported electricity 3 times higher than the export tariff.

Specifically, each household may have renewable generation, energy storage as well as inelastic and elastic energy loads, and the load serving entity attempts to coordinate the energy consumption of these households in order to minimize the total energy cost within this neighborhood. The renewable generation, the energy demand arrival, and the energy cost function are all stochastic processes and evolve according to some, possibly unknown, probabilistic laws.

Existing power grid systems are generally under-utilized with low load factors during most times of day and year, but demand strains capacity during peak hours. Brownouts and other grid failures are projected to become more common as peak demands approach grid capacities, with negative economic and public health consequences resulting. Meanwhile a financial barrier exists for the financing of grid improvements, because utility revenues are proportional to total power sales, whereas utility costs are driven largely by capital and maintenance for the fixed infrastructure.An alternative to active demand management or electrical energy storage is to shift thermal demands to off-peak hours, allowing the utility's power grid to meet much larger total demands using a fixed capacity. Thermal energy storage is a mature, energy-efficient, and possibly cost-effective technology that can be applied to buildings of all sizes, and is particularly well-suited to shift afternoon peak cooling demands to off-peak hours in hot summertime months. This simple technology, if distributed widely, can make a dramatic impact on power grid load factors in hot cities.This paper utilizes a utility-scale model of the Phoenix metropolitan area to simulate the air conditioning portion of the electrical demand during a summertime heat wave. The electrical demand by air conditioning during peak hours is incrementally shifted to off-peak hours using distributed thermal storage technology. The aggregated thermal storage capacity and operating hours required to reduce the peak load by incremental fractions are established, along with the size of the gross electrical energy cost savings potentially realized by electrical power consumers during heat wave events, at current electricity prices. \u00a9 2014 Elsevier Ltd.", "2014"]

This paper presents a novel framework for DERs aggregators to determine by optimisation the capacity of a generating unit to contract with the SO, using mixed integer non-linear programming (MINLP). Results show the site revenue increases between 6.2% and 29.8% compared to the heuristic approach previously employed. Sensitivity analysis is performed to assess the impact of temporal resolution of demand characterisation on results, showing that increased resolution improves accuracy significantly, and reduces the estimate of capacity that the site should contract with the aggregator. \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd", "2022"]

New state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) technologies are integral in optimizing decision-making in energy distribution networks and systems. This study was conducted on data-driven probabilistic ML techniques and their real-time applications to smart energy systems and networks to highlight the urgency of this area of research. This study focused on two key areas: i) the use of ML in core energy technologies and ii) the use cases of ML for energy distribution utilities. The core energy technologies include the use of ML in advanced energy materials, energy systems and storage devices, energy efficiency, smart energy material manufacturing in the smart grid paradigm, strategic energy planning, integration of renewable energy, and big data analytics in the smart grid environment. The investigated ML area in energy distribution systems includes energy consumption and price forecasting, the merit order of energy price forecasting, and the consumer lifetime value. Cybersecurity topics for power delivery and utilization, grid edge systems and distributed energy resources, power transmission, and distribution systems are also briefly studied. The primary goal of this work was to identify common issues useful in future studies on ML for smooth energy distribution operations. This study was concluded with many energy perspectives on significant opportunities and challenges.

An energy system analysis of storage, demand-side response, heating electrification, and distribution reinforcement; Abstract: This paper compares various flexibility options to support renewable energy integration across the energy transition using energy system modelling. We analyse new flexibility assets such as electricity storage, heat pumps, demand-side response with existing wet appliances, electric boilers for domestic hot water and distribution grid expansion, along with energy efficiency measures in electrical appliances and building retrofitting. We propose an open-source sector coupling model (GRIMSEL-FLEX) to minimise, from a social planner perspective, the total cost of the energy system for electricity and residential heating supply in Switzerland, including various types of consumers and urban settings. We find relevant feedback mechanisms among various flexibility options. Firstly, electric boilers have a larger flexibility potential than demand-side response with wet appliances since they reduce storage investments by more than 26% by 2050 (only 12% for demand-side response). Secondly, 34% more electricity storage is needed if heat pumps replace all fossil-based heating and 80% to replace all heating systems entirely. Thirdly, we find a shift in the operation of heat pumps, electric boilers and wet appliances from night to midday, resulting in larger photovoltaic deployment (22%\u201366% for the residential sector). Finally, electricity storage capacity induced by heat pump deployment is highly dependent on the retrofitting rate. With 1% per annum, 86% of storage investments can be avoided and it can be counterbalanced with a high retrofitting rate of 2% per annum. \u00a9 2022 The Author(s)", "2022"]

Identifying the load of induction motors non-intrusively is of great importance for the design of energy-saving schemes and formulation of demand-side response strategies in industrial enterprises. Based on the transient mechanism of the induction motor, the present work first defines some motor load start-up transient feature parameters with clear physical meanings and proposes a set of non-intrusive motor load identification methods applicable to industrial settings. In addition, a case study that applied the proposed method to the industrial setting was performed to verify its effectiveness. The results showed that the proposed method can overcome the problem of misidentification caused by the fact that the start-up transient process is affected by its mechanical load characteristics and hence can identify motors with similar running power and has good anti-interference capacity despite power quality disturbances.

The proposed UDDSR allows energy users within the community to submit flexible Demand Response (DR) bids to Community Energy Management Scheme (EMS) with flexible start time, stop time and response durations with regard to users\u2019 comfort zones for electric heating systems, electric vehicles and other home appliances, which gives maximum freedom to the DR participants. The scheduling of the DR bids, originally a multi-objective optimization problem (maximize the total flexible demand and the flexible demand in every interval during the whole DR duration), is transferred to a single objective optimization problem (maximize the total demand with penalty for demand imbalance during the whole DR duration) that can significantly decrease the computational complexity. Furthermore, to facilitate efficient energy usage among neighbourhoods, a local energy pool is also proposed to enable the energy trading among users aiming to facilitate the usage of surplus energy within the community. The electricity price of energy pool is determined by the real-time demand/supply ratio, and upper/lower limit for the price is configured to ensure the profitability for all the participants within the pool. To evaluate the performance of proposed UDDSR and local energy pool, comprehensive numerical analysis is conducted. It is found that the energy pool participants without PV can get at least 6.16% savings on electricity bill (when PV penetration level equals to 20%). The energy pool participants with PV can get much better return (at least 13.4% profit increase) on the PV generation compared to the conventional Feed-in-Tariff. If energy users join the UDDSR scheme, the participants can get further return, and the proposed UDDSR can provide a constant load reduction/increase during the every time interval of the whole DR event.

This paper empirically evaluates the impact of DSR trials on grid electricity import and resident experience regarding disruption to daily routines, thermal comfort and noise disturbance in 17 thermally efficient social housing dwellings (Barnsley, England). Four types of DSR trials were run through 22 interventions performed in March to April 2021. Each dwelling was equipped with a 5 kWh electro-chemical battery and air source heat pump, and all but one dwelling had solar photovoltaic (PV) panels (1.3\u20133.0 kWp). Interventions were applied against a flat (single) rate tariff as well as dynamic time-of-use tariffs. On average, secure turn-down interventions between 5 and 7 p.m. resulted in a reduction in grid electricity import of 1.2 kWh per household and a reduction in controllable load (heat pump plus battery energy) of 3.7 kWh per household. The batteries enabled 2.5 kWh per household of electricity to be exported to the grid for these interventions. On average, turn-up interventions between 1 and 3 p.m. resulted in an increase of 2.3 kWh per household in grid electricity import. Individual dwellings showed different levels of demand response depending on the levels and patterns of household electricity consumption. The resident experience was evaluated by means of a series of telephone surveys. Householders were generally accepting of the trials in terms of changes in indoor temperature, hot water availability, noise disturbance and disruption to household routines. However, some general concerns were raised about the energy systems relating to indoor temperature, hot water temperature and energy costs. The general acceptability of automated DSR, conditional on thermal comfort limits and manual override, is promising for the wider application of residential DSR driven by price signals, although ongoing household engagement in DSR schemes will require a continued focus on the householder experience with training and support in using new technologies. A routine period of inspection should be employed to identify any issues with energy system issues ahead of DSR initiation. \u00a9 2022 The Authors", "2022"]

Traditional system components either have limited flexibility to suppress extensive system variation, or their role is limited due to lack of proper regulatory provisions and inefficient market design. Large-scale integration of renewable energy (RE) resources (e.g., solar, wind) imposes additional variability and uncertainty to the existing system and thus enhances flexibility need. There are various solutions to the problem. Revamping system operation protocol with existing resources, retrofitting current power-generating assets, network expansion, etc. can provide flexible service. Investing in a new type of resources like energy storage and demand-side response (DSR) however, needs aggressive policy interventions and market mechanisms. Identifying suitable flexible resources and designing appropriate policy structures require long-term system planning. Traditional methods in this regard need to evolve to consider the operation-scale impact of large-scale RE integration at the planning stage such that long-term carbon emission reduction targets can be met. The approach towards transitioning into a flexible energy system can differ according to its present status. This paper focuses on the Indian power sector's perspective, which has ambitious RE integration goals. With a fast-evolving system configuration, flexibility related challenges are high in India due to weak infrastructure, inefficient regulatory policies, and aggregated planning methods. This article presents the current status of the Indian power system detailing existing technology types, regulatory norms, and future targets. It further details a comprehensive review of relevant technical options, market mechanisms and planning approaches for transitioning into a flexible power system for India. Comparative analysis with international experiences highlights the need for a major paradigm shift. A short-term transition towards becoming a flexible system can focus on developing adequate transmission infrastructure, exploit available pumped hydro storage potential and retrofitting existing coal-fired power plants. On longer-term, innovating market mechanisms and regulatory changes should drive investment into emerging flexible resources like DSR, storage, etc. Planning for this transition should be designed using improved modeling and planning approaches which should focus on the interlinking of different sector-specific models. \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd", "2020"]

However, energy storage also increases the complexity of the operation optimization of the system. Existing heuristic optimization algorithms such as genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization can hardly obtain the optimal scheduling scheme. In this paper, a hybrid optimization method that combines the GA and dynamic programming (DP) is proposed. The GA is the main optimization framework and is used to optimize the hourly set points of the power generation unit in a day. In the optimization process, the GA generates a feasible solution set, and calls the DP to calculate the optimal energy storage set points for each solution. The DP defines an hour as a decision step, and enumerates all energy storage states in each decision step. This process loops until the optimal solution is obtained. To reduce the computing time, the DP is implemented as a vectorized code. Case studies are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results demonstrate that the overall performance using the proposed method increases by 1.92% in summer and by 1.91% in winter compared with that using the traditional GA method. Furthermore, the computing time is acceptable for the scheduling of the energy system.

Demand side response (DSR) is widely viewed as a cost-effective source of flexibility, with considerable market potential. To date, the main DSR providers have been energy intensive firms. However, the expectation is that non-energy intensive consumers such as commercial firms and public sector organisations will also provide system flexibility. Despite its DSR potential, commercial and public organisations have received little attention in the literature. This paper helps address this gap by identifying and exploring barriers to the participation of large commercial firms and public sector organisations in DSR through a review of the academic and grey literature on DSR. Drawing on the literature on barriers to energy efficiency, we use concepts from orthodox and behavioural economics, organisational studies and social practice theory to frame our analysis. The article argues that barriers to participation in DSR exist at the level of the organisation and not only the site. For large commercial firms and public sector organisations, the combination of having small individual electricity loads and complex internal decision-making processes can hinder their uptake of DSR. The hidden costs of participation, issues of bounded rationality and what the energy is used for within different organisations also limit the firms\u2019 ability to participate in DSR. \u00a9 2020", "2020"]

However, quite little is known about whether consumers will switch to a TOU tariff or what might increase uptake if switching rates are lower than required. This paper presents the results of a systematized review and meta-analysis combining the results of 66 measures of uptake to a variety of TOU tariffs across 27 studies conducted in six countries. It provides the first robust estimate of consumer demand and correlates of demand for TOU tariffs that is not based on the results from just a single study or tariff. Four main conclusions emerge. First, if consumers are left to opt-in to TOU tariffs, uptake could be as low as 1% unless efforts are made to close the intention-action gap, otherwise enrolment could reach 43%. Second, if enrolment is opt-out, uptake could approach 100%. Third, whilst national surveys indicate the potential appetite for TOU tariffs in a population, they are insufficient for predicting future TOU tariff adoption rates; the median proportion of domestic energy bill payers who say they would be willing to switch to a TOU tariff in national surveys is five times higher than the median enrolment rate to TOU tariffs offered by utilities. Fourth, real-time pricing tariffs, in which the price of electricity varies freely throughout the day, are less popular than static TOU tariffs which have fixed peak and off-peak rates. This paper discusses the limitations of opt-out enrolment for TOU tariffs and presents results suggesting that small upfront payments, bill protection and automation are promising alternative methods of increasing opt-in enrolment.

Cooperating agents learn to control the flexibility offered by electric vehicles, space heating and flexible loads in a partially observable stochastic environment. In the standard independent Q-learning approach, the coordination performance of agents under partial observability drops at scale in stochastic environments. Here, the novel combination of learning from off-line convex optimisations on historical data and isolating marginal contributions to total rewards in reward signals increases stability and performance at scale. Using fixed-size Q-tables, prosumers are able to assess their marginal impact on total system objectives without sharing personal data either with each other or with a central coordinator. Case studies are used to assess the fitness of different combinations of exploration sources, reward definitions, and multi-agent learning frameworks. It is demonstrated that the proposed strategies create value at individual and system levels thanks to reductions in the costs of energy imports, losses, distribution network congestion, battery depreciation and greenhouse gas emissions. \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd", "2022"]

However, it is likely that consumers will be more actively involved in managing their energy use. Consequently, there is likely to be some disruption to the current rhythm of everyday domestic social practices. This paper considers what we can learn from people who already take a more active role in managing their energy supply, with the aim of identifying transferable lessons that could be applied to future energy system decentralization. We compare two case studies focused on people with different levels of grid connectivity - people living off-grid on narrowboats and living in semi-grid connected houses in rural Norfolk. We find that where people had constraints on their energy use, they responded in three main ways. First, they diversified their energy supplies, including adopting traditional fuels such as coal and wood. Second, people planned, monitored and shifted their energy use, responding in ways favorable to micro-generation and demand-side response. Third, people curtailed energy use. We propose that UK households may respond in similar ways to decentralized energy. Finally we consider the implications of our findings for future energy policy aimed at decentralizing energy production and supply. \u00a9 2018 The Authors", "2018"]

There are two types of results presented in the paper. Firstly, we show that residential customers reacted by lowering usage in critical peak hours by 6.30%, on average, and that 93.69% of the total consumption reduction is transferred to off-peak (earlier and later) hours on the same day. This decrease in usage is comparable with the effects of time of use (TOU) programs.

Investigating end-user activity behaviour and time use for residential energy applications; Abstract: The ability to accurately model and predict timing and duration of activities for different individuals is essential for successful and widespread Demand Side Response (DSR) policies, especially in the residential sector. Understanding what people do during the day and what factors influence their activity participation decisions is important for planning an effective DSR strategy to harness the end-user flexibility. The recent Covid-19 pandemic has shown how much activities can be shifted to a virtual mode in the presence of mobility restrictions. Further, participation in activities via digital devices (virtual activity participation) has spread across society. Such virtual activities, including teleworking, online shopping, and virtual social interactions, are observed to explicitly impact travel behaviour and activity scheduling. And yet, activity-based models of mobility and energy demand do not accommodate the trade-offs between activity types, location and virtual activity participation. This paper presents a model of activity participation that captures the relationship between the three dimensions of: activity type (such as work, study, shopping), activity location (in-home, out-of-home), and activity modality (in-person, virtual). A Multiple-Discrete Continuous Extreme Value (MDCEV) model structure is applied, and the empirical analysis is undertaken using the 2015 United Kingdom Time Use Survey (UKTUS). The model results provide insights for better understanding of the trade-offs made by individuals as they participate in and allocate time across a set of activity type-location-modality alternatives, and the heterogeneity in these trade-offs. Further, holdout sample validation and policy scenario analysis exercises are presented to demonstrate the reliability and suitability of the model for policy implications. The empirical results presented in our paper suggest that this framework embedded in an activity and agent-based simulator of energy demand will enable us to test a variety of scenarios related to end-user flexibility and activity behaviour change, including consideration of virtual activity participation trends. \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.", "2022"]

This includes the use of storage and smart appliances. However, such means are not stimulated in the electricity market(s) as there is insufficient demand for flexibility from these appliances.

DSR is an emerging approach to augment asset management in the electricity sector, where network capacity is acquired from demand side actors (e.g. major commercial customers) who reduce their electricity demand at peak times by using their own generators or by shifting electricity consumption outside peak periods. DSR has a very different institutional arrangement compared to conventional network reinforcement for peak demand, since capacity is acquired via commercial and contractual arrangements rather than ownership and property rights. Thus, we cast DSR as an institutional innovation and identify important actors in such developments. Key amongst these are \u2018aggregators\u2019 who are companies that aggregate the DSR capacity from a number of commercial customers to provide capacity for the Distribution Network Operator (DNO.) Exploratory case study research was conducted by the authors as part of a smart grid initiative, with a particular focus on the work of aggregators. Our findings identify aggregators as intermediary agents situated between utility firms and customers with DSR capacity and brokering relationships between them. Aggregators create receptivity for DSR by identifying potential adopters of DSR (e.g. distribution network operators and electricity network customers) and construct persuasive and pervasive propositions that renders DSR a valid energy management initiative that accords with an organisation's business priorities and institutional arrangements. It is through this process that aggregators are important actors who facilitate and create a tighter fit between DSR and the contexts in which it is deployed. Thus, this paper provides insights on the work of aggregators in DSR developments and identifies them as potentially important actors in smart grid futures. \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd", "2019"]

Several studies have shown that storage operation can increase emissions even if the storage has 100% turnaround efficiency. Furthermore, previous studies have relied on national-level data and given very little attention to the impacts of storage on emissions at local scales. This is an important omission, as carbon intensities can vary very significantly at sub-national scales. We introduce a novel approach to calculating regional marginal emissions factors, based on a validated power system model and regression analysis. The techniques are used to investigate the impacts of storage operation on CO2 emissions in Great Britain in 2019, under a range of operating scenarios. It is found that there are significant regional differences in storage emissions factors, with storage tending to increase emissions when used for wind balancing in areas with little wind curtailment. In contrast, the greatest emissions reductions are achieved when charging storage with otherwise-curtailed renewables and discharging to reduce peak demands in areas consuming high volumes of fossil fuel power. Over all regions and operating modes studied, the difference between the highest reduction in emissions and the highest increase in emissions is considerable, at 741 gCO2 per kWh discharged. We conclude that power system regulators should pay increased attention to the impact of storage operation on system CO2 emissions. \u00a9 2020", "2021"]

The presented iterative algorithm sequentially updates the storage operational schedule under the real-time electricity price scheme to achieve cost savings for each individual participant and the total system, while effectively avoiding the violation of local distribution network restrictions. The transmission topology is explicitly considered to investigate the impacts of transmission congestion on the electricity marginal prices. The results of a series of case studies demonstrate that the proposed coordination approach can effectively enable individual energy arbitrage and achieve 22.53 % system cost savings compared to the 10.34 % savings when coordination is absent. Moreover, the simulation results manifest that the coordinated control approach can cost-effectively perform distribution congestion management to ensure no local network is overloaded, which will cause 12.3 % increase in system operational costs. Overall, through coordinating the operation of numerous residential thermal energy storage to perform both energy arbitrage and distribution network congestion management, the proposed control approach can benefit the system operation at both the national and local levels. \u00a9 2021", "2021"]

While these microgrids appear to be pivotal in future energy systems, they impose several problems in the design and operation of the network mainly due to their complexity and the different properties that each energy subsystem has. In this work, we propose a novel, generic and systematic way of modelling the assets in a microgrid including the energy management method that is used to control the operation of these assets under multiple stochastic loads. This gives a unique tool that allows the testing/derivation of multiple energy management methods including demand side response and the usage of forecasting tools to optimise the performance of the system. A thorough study of the proposed method, using data from a real hybrid energy system (built in Greece), proves that the performance and efficiency of the system can be significantly improved while at the same time the requirement for external power supply or the consumption of fossil fuels can be reduced. The main concept is based on a state space modelling approach that transforms the power network into a hybrid dynamical system and the implemented energy management method into the evolution operator. The model integrates structural, temporal and logical features of smart grid systems in order to identify and construct multiple different energy management strategies EMS which can then be compared with respect to their ability to best serve the considered demands. Other than coping with several energy carriers, the model inherently accounts for forecasting, handles multiple random loads with time dependant importance and supports the use of demand side response strategies. Conclusions drawn from numerical case studies are used to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method. In this work we clearly show that by using 20 different energy management methods and analysing their performance through a multi-criteria assessment approach we obtain non-trivial energy management approaches to support the operation of a multi-vector smart-grid considering variable external demands. \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Ltd", "2018"]

Time-of-use rates (TOU) are a common DSR mechanism that seeks to shift electricity use to low-demand times using financial instruments. However, consumers generally have a poor understanding of their electricity use and bills, raising questions about the extent to which TOU participation is driven by perceptions of savings versus actual savings. We find that among 8,702 residents who opted into a pilot TOU programme, the TOU treatment decreases on-peak use compared to a control group, but this effect is small. Perceived savings is the strongest predictor of intent to remain on TOU, over and above actual savings, even though it is only weakly related to actual changes in bills and usage.

Time of Use tariffs, which vary the cost of energy depending on when it is used, are a proposed mechanism for DSR. However, we do not know which behaviours, if any, are amenable to being brought forward or postponed, nor what information people would need to do this. Here we presented people with hypothetical variable financial costs and, for the first time, carbon costs for future energy consumption. People's think-aloud decisions about when they would perform consumptive activities were qualitatively analysed. We show that non-daily high-consumption activities (e.g., ironing, vacuuming) are perceived as moveable in response to price changes or, notably, information about environmental consequences; but barriers to moving other activities, even in the face of higher costs or environmental harm, include household dynamics (difficulties negotiating consumption across cohabitants), social roles, community living (not wishing to disturb neighbours), lack of energy literacy and the routine nature of many tasks.

This hybrid prediction method is designed following a combination of model predictive control and extreme learning machine techniques. Based on the predicted data of distributed energy resources and three types of loads from demand-side response, an optimization model is formulated to minimize the operational cost. If some predicted data are interrupted during transmission, then a prospect vulnerability assessment method is applied to select a neighboring device to predict the interrupted data.

The intermittent nature of renewable energy is disrupting the conventional methods used in operational planning of the electrical grid, causing a shift from a day-ahead forecast policy to a real-time pricing of delivered electric power. A path towards a more renewable, robust and intelligent energy system is inevitable but poses many challenges to researchers and industry. In the field of process industry, strategies based on demand side response are receiving attention and could represent a partial solution for this challenge. Coordination between production scheduling and procurement of electric power is of high importance and can contribute to reducing cost and emissions associated with production. A methodology to quantify such benefits is presented here with a case study, which reveals the potential benefits of flexible operation. In this case, the minimum compensation for flexibility services ranges between 5 and 20 \u20ac per unit (MWh) of restricted power. However, such a compensation depends on geographic location (electricity prices) and the frequency of restrictions. The method follows a rolling scheduling approach that provides optimization of the short-term schedule. This work introduces the concept of representing flexible processes as \u2018equivalent batteries\u2019 which store electricity from low-cost periods as intermediate products and consume the embedded energy during high-cost periods. Cost related to providing flexibility combined with the profits from optimized process scheduling contribute toward monetization of flexibility as an ancillary service for the grid. Balancing this service with the cost of implementing DSR solutions provides a means for calculating a pricing strategy for grid flexibility.

It ensures that the system can keep supply and demand in balance in real time. Until recently the provision of flexibility was a fortunate by-product of thermal power generation using fossil fuels as a convenient storage medium. The rapid emergence of renewables poses a major challenge to this model. As thermal power stations are increasingly displaced with more variable renewable sources of electricity, new forms of flexibility are urgently needed. Two promising candidates for this role are energy storage and demand side response. This paper argues that in low carbon systems flexibility may at times and in certain places supersede the need for component efficiency, in order to improve overall system efficiency. We reach this conclusion after reviewing the origins of flexibility on the supply and the demand side. In both domains the concepts of material redundancy, tolerances and skills are pertinent and help our understanding of the potential for and limitations to flexibility.

Instead of building the formulation from a component level, the new formulation is built at the whole system level such that all power transfers between ac/dc or dc/ac are reflected in the ac power drawn from the main grid. This is achieved by assigning the ac power drawn from the grid as a piecewise function of local dc power, each slope in the function represents the conversion efficiency, making it flexible to consider a wide range of conversion efficiencies for different system components. The new formulation substantially reduces the number of variables/constraints, improves efficiency modelling accuracy and increases the search efficacy. The piecewise functions are directly solved by a mixed integer linear programming (MILP). The performance of the proposed formulation is illustrated by the hybrid ac/dc energy systems at a primary school in the U.K. The results show that the proposed problem formulation and the MILP solution method provide an effective optimal control strategy for a mixed ac/dc domestic energy system in the presence of variable tariffs and differing conversion efficiency, achieved a cost saving of 24% increase in energy bills compared with the traditional approach. \u00a9 2010-2012 IEEE.", "2018"]

As greater uncertainty is expected from growing distributed energy resources in distribution networks, there is an increasing risk of investing in too much or too little network capacity and hence causing the stranding and inefficient use of network assets; these costs are then passed on to the end-user. An alternative emerging solution in the context of smart grid development is to release untapped network capacity through Demand-Side Response (DSR). However, to date there is no approach able to quantify the value of \u2018smart\u2019 DSR solutions against \u2018conventional\u2019 asset-heavy investments. On these premises, this paper presents a general real options framework and a novel probabilistic tool for the economic assessment of DSR for smart distribution network planning under uncertainty, which allows the modeling and comparison of multiple investment strategies, including DSR and capacity reinforcements, based on different cost and risk metrics. In particular the model provides an explicit quantification of the economic value of DSR against alternative investment strategies. Through sensitivity analysis it is able to indicate the maximum price payable for DSR service such that DSR remains economically optimal against these alternatives. The proposed model thus provides Regulators with clear insights for overseeing DSR contractual arrangements. Further it highlights that differences exist in the economic perspective of the regulated DNO business and of customers. Our proposed model is therefore capable of highlighting instances where a particular investment strategy is favorable to the DNO but not to its customers, or vice-versa, and thus aspects of the regulatory framework which may need altering. The case study results indicate that DSR can be an economical option to delay or even avoid large irreversible capacity investments, thus reducing overall costs for networks and end customers. However, in order for the value and benefits of DSR to be acknowledged, a change in the regulatory framework (currently based on deterministic analysis) that takes explicit account of uncertainty in planning, as suggested by our work, is required. \u00a9 2016", "2016"]

The main focus of the paper is to help centralized planners to systematically discuss, select, and plan the measures that better respond to the variety of critical situations that can arise due to expected energy shortage, integrate them into the usual medium-term scheduling tool and consequently keep the associated overall costs as low as possible. A medium-term definition of the system state is proposed as a decision-making aid, as well as a set of general energy saving measures that can be applied with their corresponding attributes (time delays, costs of implementation, and energy saving impact).

Depending on network needs, these devices could alter their nominal energy consumption and provide multiple ancillary services, facilitating the cost-effective transition to a low-carbon power system. Previous work mainly focused on investigating single service provision from TCLs, while intersections among different services have not been considered. Furthermore, the intrinsic energy payback effect was not fully included within optimisation tools for TCL scheduling. This paper presents a novel demand side response model (DSRM), which enables the optimal scheduling of energy/power consumption of a heterogeneous population of TCLs and the simultaneous allocation of multiple ancillary services. The model explicitly considers the effect of the energy recovery after delivering the services so that the deliverability of scheduled services from TCLs is always guaranteed. The proposed DSRM is integrated into an advanced stochastic unit commitment model to investigate the system benefits of the flexibility from TCLs. Case studies demonstrate that: 1) time-varying provision of multiple services from TCLs significantly increases their benefits; 2) TCL operation which aims to minimise the amplitude of the energy recovery causes sub-optimal utilisation of the devices; and 3) ignoring the energy payback leads to overestimate the TCL value. \u00a9 2010-2012 IEEE.", "2018"]

This paper presents the results of a survey experiment conducted on a nationally representative sample of 2020 British energy bill payers. The data suggests that over a third of bill payers are in favour of switching to a 3-tiered smart time of use tariff, indicating a sizeable potential market for these tariffs. There is substantial variation in willingness to switch, driven by differences in loss-aversion and ownership of demand flexible appliances rather than standard socio-economic/demographic factors. This is the first time loss-aversion has been measured amongst energy bill payers and the results suggest loss-aversion is likely to stifle consumer uptake; 93% of bill payers are loss-averse (care more about avoiding financial losses than making savings) and loss-averse people are substantially less willing to switch to the time of use tariff (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001).

As the amount of intermittent renewable generation increases and the proportion of flexible conventional generating units decreases, a contribution from the demand side to primary frequency control becomes technically and economically desirable. One of the reasons why this has not been done was the perceived difficulties in dealing with many small loads rather than a limited number of generating units.

This is mainly due to uncertainties caused by prediction errors in renewable generation. In order to maintain power system security, the participation of demand side response to the balancing services such as operating reserve is critical. In this paper, the capability of smart appliances to act as operating reserves for the system operator is investigated. The smart appliances considered are washing machines, dish washers and tumble dryers equipped with communication modules. A novel framework is introduced which enables system operators to access demand response from smart appliances in a timeframe suitable for operating reserves. A mathematical model is developed to simulate appliances with multiple discrete power phases. The delay and interruption of appliances cycles are considered in the model. A multiple time-step simulation is introduced that assesses the load reduction from a number of households as a response to a reserve instruction which is modelled as a price increase with a short notification period. The results are used to estimate the available demand response from Great Britain (GB) households at any moment of the day. With a 20% penetration of smart appliances, the demand response can provide up to 54% of the operating reserve requirements of the GB power system depending on the time of day. \u00a9 2014 The Authors.", "2015"]
